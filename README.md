This is a fork of the [NiuTrans Classical-Modern](https://github.com/NiuTrans/Classical-Modern) dataset with added Modern English translation of the Modern Chinese.  
The English translation was generated with Meta's [WMT 21 X-En](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wmt21-dense-24-wide-x-en).  
This being a machine translation, certain problems and imperfections in the output are to be expected. For example, translation of named entities can be unreliable, especially for rare entities.  
For the source of the files please see the original NiuTrans repository.  
Research conducted within the MITRA project at UC Berkeley under Prof. Kurt Keutzer at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR).
