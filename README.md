This is a fork of the [NiuTrans Classical-Modern](https://github.com/NiuTrans/Classical-Modern) dataset with added modern English translation of the modern Chinese.  
The English translation was generated with Meta's [WMT 21 X-En](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wmt21-dense-24-wide-x-en).  
For the source of the files please see the original NiuTrans repository.  
Research conducted within the MITRA project at UC Berkeley under Prof. Kurt Keutzer at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR).
