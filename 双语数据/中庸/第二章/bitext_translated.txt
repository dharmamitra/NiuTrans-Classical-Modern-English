古文：仲尼曰： 君子中庸；小人反中庸。 
现代文：仲尼说： 君子遵循中庸之道为人处世，小人对人对事往往违背中庸的准则。 
English: Zhong Ni said: A gentleman follows the middle way in dealing with people, and a villain often violates the middle way in dealing with people.

古文： 君子之中庸也，君子而时中。小人之反中庸也，小人而无忌惮也。 
现代文： 君子的言行符合中庸，是因为君子能随时根据不同的情况，恰到好处地把握中正的原则，行事处世有度；小人之所以背离中庸，是因为他们不能约束自己的言行，主观武断，没有准则，无所顾忌。 
English: The words and deeds of a gentleman are in line with the middle way, because a gentleman can grasp the principle of the middle way at any time according to different situations, and act appropriately in the world; the reason why villains deviate from the middle way is because they cannot restrain their words and deeds, are subjective and arbitrary, have no standards, and have no scruples.
