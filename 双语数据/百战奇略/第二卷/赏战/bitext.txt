古文：凡高城深池，矢石繁下，士卒争先登；白刃始合，士卒争先赴者，必诱之以重赏，则敌无不克焉。
现代文：凡是在攻城作战中遇到高墙深壕，守城的用箭石不断向下抛射的时候，要使我方士兵争先恐后地攀登城垣；当两军短兵相接，展开白刃格斗的时候，要使士兵奋不顾身地前赴后继，都必须用重赏来加以鼓励，这样就没有无法攻克的城池。
English: Whenever we encounter high walls and deep trenches in the siege of the city, and the defenders of the city are constantly throwing downwards with arrow stones, our soldiers should scramble to climb the city wall; when the two armies are close together and engage in hand-to-hand combat, the soldiers must be encouraged with rewards if they want to go ahead regardless of their own lives, so that there is no city that cannot be conquered.

古文：法曰： 重赏之下，必有勇夫。 
现代文：诚如兵法所说： 重赏激励之下，必会有勇士出现。 
English: As it is said in the art of war: under the encouragement of rewards, there will surely be warriors.

古文：汉末，大将曹操每攻城破邑，得靡丽之物，则悉以赏有功者。
现代文：东汉末年，大将曹操每当攻下敌人城池时，对所缴获来的贵重财物，全部都用以奖赏有功将士。
English: In the last years of the Eastern Han Dynasty, whenever General Cao Cao captured an enemy city, he used all of the valuable property captured to reward meritorious soldiers.

古文：若勋劳宜赏，不吝千金；无功妄施，分毫不与。
现代文：功劳显著的就会重赏，即使赏赐千金也毫不吝惜；但对那些无功而妄想索赏的人，是分毫都不会给。
English: Those with outstanding merits will be rewarded, and even if they are rewarded with thousands of dollars, they will not begrudge it; but for those who have no merit and want to be rewarded, they will not be given anything.

古文：故能每战必胜。
现代文：所以，曹操每次率军作战都必定取得胜利。
English: Therefore, Cao Cao was sure to win every time he led his army into battle.
