古文：于是焉河伯始旋其面目，望洋向若而叹曰： 野语有之曰： 闻道百，以为莫己若者。 我之谓也。
现代文：在这个时候河伯转变了原来欣然自得的表情，面对海神若仰首慨叹道： 有句俗话说， 听到了许多道理，就以为没有人比得上自己 ，说的就是我这样的人了。
English: At this time, Hebe changed his originally pleased and self-satisfied expression, and in the face of the sea god, he looked up and sighed: There is a saying that when you hear a lot of truth, you think that no one is comparable to yourself, and they are talking about people like me.

古文：且夫我尝闻少仲尼之道而轻伯夷之义者，始吾弗信。今我睹子之难穷也，吾非至于子之门则殆矣，吾长见笑于大方之家。 
现代文：况且我曾听说有人认为孔子的见闻浅陋，伯夷的道义微不足道，开始我还不相信;如今我看见您的广阔无边，我如果不是来到您的面前来，那就危险了，我会永远被有学识的人所讥笑。

古文：北海若曰： 井蛙不可以语于海者，拘于虚也；夏虫不可以语于冰者，笃于时也；曲士不可以语于道者，束于教也。
现代文：北海神若说： 对井里的青蛙不能够与它沟通讨论关于大海的事情，是因为井口局限了它的眼界;夏天的虫子不能够与它谈论关于冰雪的事情，是因为它被生存的时令所限制;对见识浅陋的人不可与他谈论道理的问题，是因为他的眼界受着教养的束缚。
English: The god of the North Sea said: For the frog in the well, it is not possible to communicate with it and discuss things about the sea, because the wellhead limits its field of vision; the summer bug cannot talk to it about ice and snow, because it is limited by the season of existence; for the shallow-minded person, it is not possible to talk to him about the problem of reason, because his field of vision is bound by education.

古文：今尔出于崖涘，观于大海，乃知尔丑，尔将可与语大理矣。

现代文：天下的水，没有比海更大的了。万千条江河归向大海，不知什么时候停止，可大海却不会满溢出来;海底的尾闾泄漏海水，不知什么时候才会停止，但海水却不曾减少;海水不因季节的变化而有所增减，也不因水灾旱灾而受影响。
English: There is no greater water under the sky than the sea. Thousands of rivers flow to the sea, and I don't know when they will stop, but the sea will not overflow; the sea water leaks from the bottom of the sea, and I don't know when it will stop, but the sea water has not decreased; the sea water does not increase or decrease due to seasonal changes, nor is it affected by floods and droughts.

现代文：但是我未曾藉此自我夸耀，因为自从天地之间生成形态，从那里汲取阴阳之气，我在天地里面，犹如小石小木在大山上一样，正感觉自己见到的太少，又哪里还能自傲呢？

现代文：人们用 万 这个数字来称呼物类，人不过占其中之一;人类遍布天下，谷物所生长的地方，车船所通达的地方都有人，每人只是占其中的一个;这表明人与万物相比，不像毫毛的末梢在马体上吗？
English: People use the number ten thousand to refer to species, but human beings are only one of them; human beings are all over the world, wherever grain is grown, wherever cars and ships pass, there are people, and each person is only one of them; does this mean that compared to all things, human beings are not like the hairless tips on a horse's body?

古文：五帝之所连，三王之所争，仁人之所忧，任士之所劳，尽此矣！
现代文：五帝所连续统治的，三王所争夺的，仁人所担忧的，以天下为己任的贤人所劳碌的，全不过如此而已。

古文：伯夷辞之以为名，仲尼语之以为博。此其自多也，不似尔向之自多于水乎？ 
现代文：伯夷以辞让君王位置而博得名声，孔子以谈论天下而显示渊博，他们这样自我夸耀，不正像你先前看到河水上涨而自满一样吗？

古文：北海若曰： 否。
现代文：海神回答： 不可以。
English: The sea god replied: "No."

古文：夫物，量无穷，时无止，分无常，终始无故。
现代文：万物的量是无穷无尽的，时间是没有终点的，得与失的禀分没有不变的常规，事物的终结和起始也没有固定。
English: The quantity of all things is inexhaustible, time has no end, gain and loss have no invariable rules, and the end and beginning of things are not fixed.

古文：是故大知观于远近，故小而不寡，大而不多：知量无穷。证向今故，故遥而不闷，掇而不跂：知时无止。察乎盈虚，故得而不喜，失而不忧：知分之无常也。明乎坦涂，故生而不说，死而不祸：知终始之不可故也。
现代文：所以具有大智的人观察事物从不局限于一隅，因而体积小却不看作就是少，体积大却不看作就是多，这是因为知道事物的量是不可穷尽的;证验并明察古往今来的各种情况，因而寿命久远却不感到厌倦，生命只在近前却不会企求寿延，这是因为知道时间的推移是没有止境的;洞悉事物有盈有虚的规律，因而有所得却不欢欣喜悦，有所失也不悔恨忧愁，这是因为知道得与失的禀分是没有定规的;明了生与死之间犹如一条没有阻隔的平坦大道，因而生于世间不会倍加欢喜，死离人世不觉祸患加身，这是因为知道终了和起始是不会一成不变的。
English: Therefore, a person of great wisdom never confines his observation to a corner, and thus does not regard smallness as smallness, and does not regard largeness as largeness, because he knows that the quantity of things is inexhaustible; he verifies and observes the various situations from ancient times to the present, so he lives for a long time but does not feel bored, life is only near but does not seek to prolong life, because he knows that there is no limit to time; he knows that there is a law of gain and loss, so he does not rejoice and rejoice, and he does not regret and grieve, because he knows that there is no fixed division between gain and loss; he knows that

古文：计人之所知，不若其所不知；其生之时，不若未生之时；以其至小，求穷其至大之域，是故迷乱而不能自得也。
现代文：算算人所懂得的知识，远远不如他所不知道的东西多，他生存的时间，也远远不如他不在人世的时间长;用极为有限的智慧去探究没有穷尽的境域，所以内心迷乱而必然不能有所得!
English: A man of calculation knows far less than he does not know, and lives far less than he does not live; he uses his extremely limited wisdom to explore the inexhaustible territory, so his heart is confused and he cannot gain anything!

古文：由此观之，又何以知毫末之足以定至细之倪，又何以知天地之足以穷至大之域！ 
现代文：由此看来，又怎么知道毫毛的末端就可以判定是最为细小的限度呢？又怎么知道天与地就可以看作是最大的境域呢？ 
English: From this point of view, how do we know that the end of a millimeter can be judged as the smallest limit? How do we know that heaven and earth can be regarded as the largest territory?

古文：河伯曰： 世之议者皆曰： 至精无形，至大不可围。 
现代文：河神说： 世间议论的人们总是说： 最细小的东西没有形体可寻，最巨大的东西不可限定范围 。
English: River God said: People in the world always say: The smallest thing has no shape to be found, the largest thing cannot be limited in scope.

古文：是信情乎？ 
现代文：这样的话是真实可信的吗？ 
English: Is this true and believable?

古文：北海若曰： 夫自细视大者不尽，自大视细者不明。
现代文：海神回答： 从细小的角度看庞大的东西不可能全面，从巨大的角度看细小的东西不可能真切。
English: The sea god replied, "From a small point of view, a huge thing cannot be comprehensive, and from a huge point of view, a small thing cannot be true."

古文：夫精，小之微也；郛，大之殷也：故异便。此势之有也。
现代文：精细，是小中之小;庞大，是大中之大;不过大小虽有不同却各有各的合宜之处。
English: Fine is the smallest of the small; huge is the largest of the large; but although there are differences in size, each has its own appropriate place.

古文：夫精粗者，期于有形者也；无形者，数之所不能分也；不可围者，数之所不能穷也。
现代文：这就是事物固有的态势。所谓精细与粗大，仅限于有形的东西，至于没有形体的事物，是不能用计算数量的办法来加以剖解的;而不可限定范围的东西，更不是用数量能够精确计算的。
English: This is the inherent situation of things. The so-called fine and coarse are limited to tangible things. As for things without shape, they cannot be dissected by calculating the quantity; and things that are not limited in scope cannot be accurately calculated by quantity.

古文：可以言论者，物之粗也；可以意致者，物之精也；言之所不能论，意之所不能察致者，不期精粗焉。
现代文：可以用言语来谈论的东西，是事物粗浅的外在表象;可以用心意来传告的东西，则是事物精细的内在实质。言语所不能谈论的，心意所不能传告的，也就不限于精细和粗浅的范围了。
English: What can be talked about with words is the superficial appearance of things; what can be conveyed with the mind is the subtle inner essence of things. What cannot be talked about with words and cannot be conveyed with the mind is not limited to the scope of subtlety and shallowness.

古文：是故大人之行：不出乎害人，不多仁恩；动不为利，不贱门隶；货财弗争，不多辞让；事焉不借人，不多食乎力，不贱贪污；行殊乎俗，不多辟异；为在从众，不贱佞谄；世之爵禄不足以为劝，戮耻不足以为辱；知是非之不可为分，细大之不可为倪。
现代文：所以修养高尚者的行动，不会出于对人的伤害，也不会赞赏给人以仁慈和恩惠;无论干什么都不是为了私利，也不会轻视从事守门差役之类的人。无论什么财物都不去争夺，也不推重谦和与辞让;凡事从不借助他人的力气，但也不提倡自食其力，同时也不鄙夷贪婪与污秽;行动与世俗不同，但不主张邪僻乖异;行为追随一般的人，也不以奉承和谄媚为卑贱;人世间的所谓高官厚禄不足以作为劝勉，刑戮和侮辱不足以看作是羞耻;知道是与非的界线不能清楚地划分，也懂得细小和巨大不可能确定清晰的界限。
English: Therefore, the actions of cultivating noble people will not be out of harm to people, nor will they praise people with mercy and grace; no matter what they do, they will not be for self-interest, nor will they despise people who work as gatekeepers. No matter what kind of wealth, they will not compete, nor will they promote modesty and concession; they will never use the strength of others in everything, but they will not promote self-sufficiency, nor will they despise greed and filth; they will act differently from the world, but they will not advocate eccentricity; they will follow ordinary people, and they will not be inferior to flattery and flattery; the

古文：闻曰： 道人不闻，至德不得，大人无己。 
现代文：听人说： 能体察大道的人不求闻达于世，修养高尚的人不会计较得失，清虚宁寂的人能够忘却自己 。
English: The listener said: Those who can experience the road do not seek to hear and reach the world, those who are cultivated and noble do not care about gains and losses, and those who are pure and quiet can forget themselves.

古文：约分之至也。 
现代文：这就是约束自己而达到适得其分的境界。 
English: It's about disciplining yourself to get the right score.

古文：河伯曰： 若物之外，若物之内，恶至而倪贵贱？
现代文：河神说： 如此事物的外表，如此事物的内在，从何处来区分它们的贵贱？
English: The river god said, "From where does the appearance of such a thing, and the inside of such a thing, come from to distinguish their worthiness?"

古文：恶至而倪小大？ 
现代文：又怎么来区别它们的大小？ 
English: And how can you tell the difference in size?

古文：北海若曰： 以道观之，物无贵贱；以物观之，自贵而相贱；以俗观之，贵贱不在己。
现代文：海神回答： 用自然的常理来看，万物本没有贵贱的区别。从万物自身来看，各自为贵而又以他物为贱。拿世俗的观点来看，贵贱不在于事物自身。
English: The sea god replied: According to the common sense of nature, there is no difference between the precious and the worthless in all things. According to the things themselves, each one is precious and the other is worthless. According to the worldly point of view, the precious and worthless do not lie in the things themselves.

古文：以差观之，因其所大而大之，则万物莫不大；因其所小而小之，则万物莫不小。知天地之为稊米也，知毫末之为丘山也，则差数睹矣。
现代文：按照物与物之间的差别来看，顺着各种物体大的一面去观察便会认为物体是大的，那么万物就没有什么不是大的;顺着各种物体小的一面去观察便会认为物体是小的，那么万物没有什么不是小的;知晓天地虽大比起更大的东西来也如小小的米粒，知晓毫毛之末虽小比起更小的东西来也如高大的山丘，而万物的差别和数量也就看得很清楚了。
English: According to the difference between things, if you look at the big side of things, you will think that the object is big, so there is nothing that is not big; if you look at the small side of things, you will think that the object is small, so there is nothing that is not small; if you know that the heavens and the earth are large compared to larger things, they are like small grains of rice, and if you know that the end of a hair is small compared to smaller things, they are like tall hills, and the difference and quantity of all things are very clear.

古文：以功观之，因其所有而有之，则万物莫不有；因其所无而无之，则万物莫不无。知东西之相反而不可以相无，则功分定矣。
现代文：依照事物的功用来看，顺着物体所具有的一面去观察便会认为具有了这样的功能，那么万物就没有什么不具有这样的功能;顺着物体所不具有的一面去观察便会认为不具有这样的功能，那么万物就没有什么具有了这样的功能;可知东与西的方向对立相反却又不可以相互缺少，而事物的功用与本分便得以确定。
English: According to the function of things, observing along the side of the object will think that it has such a function, so there is nothing that does not have such a function; observing along the side that the object does not have will think that it does not have such a function, so there is nothing that has such a function; it can be seen that East and West are opposite directions, but they cannot lack each other, and the function and duty of things can be determined.

古文：以趣观之，因其所然而然之，则万物莫不然；因其所非而非之，则万物莫不非。知尧、桀之自然而相非，则趣操睹矣。
现代文：从人们对事物的趋向来看，顺着各种事物肯定的一面去观察便会认为是对的，那么万物没有什么不是对的;顺着各种事物否定的一面去观察便会认为是不对的，那么万物没有什么不是错的;知晓唐尧和夏桀都自以为正确又相互否定对方，而人们的趋向与持守也就看得很清楚了。
English: From the perspective of people's tendency towards things, if people observe the positive side of various things, they will think it is right, so there is nothing wrong with all things; if they observe the negative side of various things, they will think it is wrong, so there is nothing wrong with all things; knowing that Tang Xuan and Xia Xuan both think they are right and deny each other, people's tendency and adherence are also very clear.

古文：昔者尧、舜让而帝，之、哙让而绝；汤、武争而王，白公争而灭。
现代文：当年唐尧、虞舜禅让而称帝，宰相子之与燕王哙禅让而燕国几乎灭亡;商汤、周武王都争夺天下而成为帝王，白公胜争夺王位却遭致杀身。
English: At that time, Tang Xuan and Yu Xi Zen conceded and became emperors, the Prime Minister's son and Yan Wang conceded and Yan's country almost perished; Shang Tang and Zhou Wu Wang both competed for the world and became emperors, Bai Gong won the competition for the throne but was killed.

古文：由此观之，争让之礼，尧、桀之行，贵贱有时，未可以为常也。
现代文：由此看来，争斗与禅让的礼制，唐尧与夏桀的作法，认可还是鄙夷都会因时而异，不可以把它们看作是不变的规律。
English: From this point of view, the etiquette of fighting and surrendering, the practices of Tang and Xia, and whether they are approved or despised will vary from time to time, and they cannot be regarded as unchanging laws.

古文：梁丽可以冲城而不可以窒穴，言殊器也；骐骥骅骝一日而驰千里，捕鼠不如狸狌，言殊技也；鸱鸺夜撮蚤，察毫末，昼出瞋目而不见丘山，言殊性也。
现代文：栋梁之材可以用来冲击敌城，却不可以用来堵塞洞穴，说的是器物的用处不一样。骏马良驹一天奔驰上千里，捕捉老鼠却不如野猫与黄鼠狼，说的是技能不一样。猫头鹰夜里能抓取小小的跳蚤，细察毫毛之末，可是大白天睁大眼睛也看不见高大的山丘，说的是禀性不一样。
English: The timber of the pillars can be used to attack the enemy city, but it cannot be used to block the caves, saying that the usefulness of the equipment is different. The horseshoe crab gallops thousands of miles a day, but it is not as good as the wildcat and the weasel to catch mice, saying that the skills are different. The owl can catch small fleas at night and carefully inspect the hair, but it can't see the tall hills with its eyes wide open during the day, saying that the toughness is different.

古文：故曰：盖师是而无非，师治而无乱乎？
现代文：所以说：怎么只看重对的一面而忽略不对的一面、看重治而忽略乱呢？
English: Therefore, it is said: how can we only value the right side and ignore the wrong side, value governance and ignore chaos?

古文：是未明天地之理，万物之情也。
现代文：这是因为不明了自然存在的道理和万物自身的实情。
English: This is because they do not understand the reason for the existence of nature and the truth of all things themselves.

古文：是犹师天而无地，师阴而无阳，其不可行明矣！
现代文：这就像是重视天而轻视地、重视阴而轻视阳，那不可行是十分明白的了。
English: It's like valuing the sky and despising the sun, valuing the yin and despising the yang. It's very clear that it's not possible.

古文：然且语而不舍，非愚则诬也！
现代文：然而还是要谈论不休，不是愚昧便是欺骗!
English: However, we still have to talk about it all the time, whether it is stupidity or deception!

古文：帝王殊禅，三代殊继。
现代文：远古帝王的禅让各不相同，夏、商、周三代的继承也各不一样。
English: The reigns of the ancient emperors were all different, and the succession of the Xia, Shang and San dynasties was also different.

古文：差其时，逆其俗者，谓之篡夫；当其时，顺其俗者，谓之义之徒。
现代文：不合时代、背逆世俗的人，称他叫篡逆之徒;合于时代、顺应世俗的人，称他叫高义之士。
English: Those who are out of step with the times and rebel against the world are called usurpers; those who are in step with the times and conform to the world are called men of high integrity.

古文：默默乎河伯，女恶知贵贱之门，小大之家！ 
现代文：沉默下来吧，河神!你怎么会懂得万物间贵贱的门庭和大小的流别! 
English: Be silent, river god! How can you understand the noble and lowly gates of all things and the parting of great and small!

古文：河伯曰： 然则我何为乎？
现代文：河神说： 既然这样，那么我应该做些什么呢？
English: The river god said, "Since this is the case, what should I do?"

古文：何不为乎？
现代文：又应该不做什么呢？
English: What should we not do?

古文：吾辞受趣舍，吾终奈何？ 
现代文：我将怎样推辞或接纳、趋就或舍弃，我终究将怎么办？ 
English: How will I reject or accept, converge or abandon, what will I do in the end?

古文：北海若曰： 以道观之，何贵何贱，是谓反衍；无拘而志，与道大蹇。
现代文：海神回答： 用道的观点来观察，什么是贵什么是贱，这可称之为循环往复;不必束缚你的心志，而跟大道相违碍。
English: The sea god replied: Using the Tao's perspective to observe what is expensive and what is cheap, this can be called a cycle; you don't have to bind your mind and get in the way of the road.

古文：何少何多，是谓谢施；无一而行，与道参差。
现代文：什么是少什么是多，这可称之为更替续延;不要偏执于事物的某一方面行事，而跟大道不相一致。
English: What is less is more, which can be called replacement and extension; do not be paranoid about one aspect of things and act in a way that is not consistent with the road.

古文：严乎若国之有君，其无私德；繇繇乎若祭之有社，其无私福；泛泛乎其若四方之无穷，其无所畛域。兼怀万物，其孰承翼？
现代文：端庄、威严的样子像是一国的国君，确实没有一点儿偏私的恩惠;优游自得的样子像是祭祀中的土地神，确实没有任何偏私的赐福;浩瀚周遍的样子像是通达四方而又旷远无穷，确实没有什么区分界限;兼蓄并且包藏万物，难道谁专门有所承受或者有所庇护？
English: The dignified and majestic appearance is like the sovereign of a country, and there is really no favor of partiality at all; the appearance of self-sufficiency is like the land god in the sacrifice, and there is really no blessing of partiality; the appearance of vastness and ubiquity is like reaching the four directions and is far and wide, and there is really no distinction of boundaries; and it is inclusive and contains all things. Who specifically has something to bear or have shelter?

古文：是谓无方。
现代文：这就称作不偏执于事物的任何一个方面。
English: This is called not being attached to any one aspect of things.

古文：万物一齐，孰短孰长？
现代文：宇宙万物本是浑同齐一的，谁优谁劣呢？
English: All things in the universe are originally one and the same. Who is superior and who is inferior?

古文：道无终始，物有死生，不恃其成。
现代文：大道没有终结和起始，万物却都有死有生，因而不可能依仗一时的成功。
English: There is no end or beginning to the road, but everything has a life and death, so it is impossible to rely on a one-time success.

古文：一虚一满，不位乎其形。

English: From time to time, emptiness and fullness, things never stick to a certain unchanging form.

古文：年不可举，时不可止。消息盈虚，终则有始。
现代文：岁月不可以挽留，时间从不会停息，消退、生长、充实、空虚，宇宙万物终结便又有了开始。

古文：何为乎，何不为乎？
现代文：应该做些什么呢？又应该不做什么呢？
English: What should be done? What should not be done?

古文：夫固将自化。 
现代文：一切必定都将自然地变化! 
English: Everything is bound to change naturally!

古文：河伯曰： 然则何贵于道邪？ 
现代文：河神说： 既然如此，那么为什么还要那么看重大道呢？ 
English: The river god said, "Since this is the case, then why do you still care so much about the Great Way?

古文：北海若曰： 知道者必达于理，达于理者必明于权，明于权者不以物害己。
现代文：海神回答： 懂得大道的人必定通达事理，通达事理的人必定明白应变，明白应变的人定然不会因为外物而损伤自己。
English: The sea god replied, "Those who know the road must be able to reason, and those who are able to reason must know how to cope, and those who know how to cope will certainly not hurt themselves because of foreign objects."

古文：至德者，火弗能热，水弗能溺，寒暑弗能害，禽兽弗能贼。
现代文：道德修养高尚的人烈焰不能烧灼他们，洪水不能沉溺他们，严寒酷暑不能侵扰他们，飞禽走兽不能伤害他们。
English: For those with high moral character, fire cannot burn them, flood cannot drown them, cold and heat cannot touch them, and birds and beasts cannot harm them.

古文：非谓其薄之也，言察乎安危，宁于祸福，谨于去就，莫之能害也。
现代文：不是说他们逼近水火、寒暑的侵扰和禽兽的伤害而能幸免，而是说他们明察安危，安于祸福，慎处离弃与追求，因而没有什么东西能够伤害他们。
English: It does not mean that they can avoid approaching water and fire, cold and heat, and the harm of animals and beasts, but that they can see the danger, accept the misfortune and good fortune, and carefully abandon and pursue, so nothing can hurt them.

古文：故曰： 天在内，人在外，德在乎天。 
现代文：所以说： 天然蕴含于内里，人为显露于外在，高尚的修养则顺应自然。
