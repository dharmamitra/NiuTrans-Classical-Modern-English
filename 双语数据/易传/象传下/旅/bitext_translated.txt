古文：山上有火，旅；君子以明慎用刑，而不留狱。
现代文：《旅卦》的卦象是艮下离上，为火势匆匆蔓延之表象，象征行旅之人匆匆赶路；君子观此应谨慎使用刑罚，明断决狱。
English: The "traveler's riddle" of the "Traveler's riddle" is like a riddle from the bottom to the top, a symbol of the rapid spread of fire, symbolizing a traveler hurrying along the road; a gentleman watching this should be careful to use punishment, and should definitely break out of prison.

古文：旅焚其次，亦以伤矣。以旅与下，其义丧也。旅于处，未得位也。得其资斧，心未快也。终以誉命，上逮也。以旅在上，其义焚也。丧牛于易，终莫之闻也。
现代文： 旅行之始猥琐不堪 ，是意志穷迫造成的灾祸。 有童仆照顾，能坚守正道 ，故不会有过失。 旅途中施舍失火 ，已经受到损伤；把童仆视为路人，童仆舍其而去，是必然的，合乎道理的。 身处异乡暂为栖身，不能安居 ，因为毕竟未得到长久安身的地方； 虽然得到路费 ，但仍然客居他乡，故此时心中仍不畅快。 最终获得荣誉和爵命 ，是由于能亲近居高位的尊者。 作为旅客却在异乡身居高位，这样必然要遭到焚巢之灾；牧人在牧场丢失了牛，这个，可悲的结局是无可挽回的。
English: The beginning of the journey is tedious and troublesome, which is a calamity caused by the poverty of the will. If you have a child servant to take care of, you can stick to the right path, so you will not make mistakes. If you give alms during the journey, it will be damaged; it is inevitable and reasonable to regard the child servant as a passer-by, and the child servant will give it up. If you are temporarily living in a foreign country, you cannot live in peace, because you have not got a place to stay for a long time; although you have received travel expenses, you still live in a foreign country, so your heart is still not happy at this time.
