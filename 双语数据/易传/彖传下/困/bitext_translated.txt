古文：困，刚揜也。
现代文：困，阳刚被掩蔽。
English: Tired, masculine and covered up.

古文：险以说，困而不失其所亨，其唯君子乎。
现代文：虽处危险之中而乐观喜悦，穷困而不失其道，故 亨通 。
English: Though in danger, he is optimistic and joyful; though in poverty, he does not lose his way, and so he succeeds.

古文：贞大人吉，以刚中也。有言不信，尚口乃穷也。
现代文：这恐怕只有君子吧。 占问大人吉祥 ，因阳刚居中。 虽有方相劝而不相信 ，崇尚空口无凭，必遭穷困。
English: I'm afraid it's only for gentlemen. It's auspicious to ask an adult for fortune-telling, because the masculine resides in the middle. Although there are people who advise but don't believe, advocating empty talk without evidence, they will suffer poverty.
