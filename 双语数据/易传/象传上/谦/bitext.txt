古文：地中有山，谦；君子以裒多益寡，称物平施。谦谦君子，卑以自牧也。
现代文： 《谦卦》的卦象是艮下坤上，为高山隐藏于地中之表象，象征高才美德隐藏于心中而不外露，所以称作谦。君子总是损多益少，衡量各种事物，然后取长补短，使其平均。
English: The Chinese character for "modesty" (謙卦) is similar to the Chinese character for "humility" (下坤) and is the image of a mountain hidden in the ground. It symbolizes that the virtue of high ability is hidden in the heart without being exposed, so it is called modesty. A gentleman always loses more and gains less, measures various things, and then takes the strengths and makes up for the weaknesses to make it average.

古文：鸣谦贞吉，中心得也。劳谦君子，万民服也。无不利撝谦，不违则也。利用侵伐，征不服也。鸣谦，志未得也。可用行师，征邑国也。
现代文： 谦虚而又谦虚的君子 ，即使处于卑微的地位，也能以谦虚的态度自我约束；而不因为位卑，就在品德方面放松修养。 谦虚的美名远扬四方，固守中正就可获得吉祥 ，这是说六二爻以心中纯正赢得名声，而不是靠沽名钓誉获取名声。 勤劳而又谦虚的君子，必能把美德保持到底 ，所以天下的老百姓都服从他。 没有任何不吉利，要发扬光大谦虚的美德 这不违背谦虚导致亨通的原则。 有利于出兵讨伐 ，是指征伐那些骄横而不可一世的人。 谦虚的美名远扬四方 ，但安邦定国之志未酬，所以 可用出师征讨 的办法来惩处那些骄横不可一世的小国。
English: A humble and modest gentleman, even if he is in a lowly position, can restrain himself with a humble attitude; and not because of his lowly position, he can relax his moral cultivation. The reputation of modesty spreads far and wide, and he can gain auspiciousness while adhering to it. This means that the 62nd generation won fame with a pure heart, rather than gaining fame by chasing fame. A hard-working and modest gentleman will be able to maintain virtue to the end, so the people of the world will obey him. There is no unlucky, and the virtue of great modesty should be carried forward. This does not violate the principle that modesty leads to success. It is beneficial
