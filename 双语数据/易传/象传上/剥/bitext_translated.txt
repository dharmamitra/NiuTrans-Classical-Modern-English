古文：山附于地，剥；上以厚下安宅。
现代文：《剥卦》的卦象是坤下艮上，好比高山受侵蚀而风化，逐渐接近于地面之表象，因而象征剥落；位居在上的人看到这一现象，应当加强基础，使它更加厚实，只有这样才能巩固其住所而不至发生危险。
English: The gaga in "Peeled Gua" is like the lower gong on the gong, like the erosion and weathering of a high mountain, gradually approaching the surface of the ground, thus symbolizing peeling; those who are at the top see this phenomenon and should strengthen the foundation and make it thicker, only in this way can they consolidate their residence without danger.

古文：剥床以足，以灭下也。
现代文： 剥落床体先由床的最下方床腿部位开始 ，是说先损毁床的基础。
English: The flaking bed body starts from the bottom of the bed leg, which is the foundation of the first damage to the bed.

古文：剥床以辨，未有与也。剥之无咎，失上下也。剥床以肤，切近灾也。
现代文：基础损坏毁灭了，自然就会有凶险的情况发生，而且还会逐渐扩展波及到上面。 床腿剥掉后，又开始剥落床头 ，是因为六二爻没有相应的阳爻援助。
English: If the foundation is damaged and destroyed, a dangerous situation will naturally occur, and it will gradually spread to the top. After the bed legs are peeled off, the head of the bed begins to peel off again, because there is no corresponding impotence aid.

古文：以宫人宠，终无尤也。君子得舆，民所载也。小人剥庐，终不可用也。
现代文：由于没有外援，所以导致凶险的情况发生。 虽被剥落，却没有什么灾祸 ，是因为六三脱离了上下阴爻的行列，而独与阳爻上九相应，由于它潜藏着阳刚的性质，所以仍然可以免灾祸。 床头剥落完了，又开始剥落床面 ，是说已经迫近灾祸了。
English: Because there is no foreign aid, it leads to the occurrence of dangerous situations. Although it has been peeled off, there is no disaster, because 63 is out of the ranks of the upper and lower pubic lice, and only corresponds to the impotence of the upper nine, because it has a latent masculine nature, so it can still avoid disaster. After the head of the bed is peeled off, the bed surface begins to peel off again, which means that the disaster is already approaching.
