古文：天下雷行，物与无妄；先王以茂对时育万物。无妄之往，得志也。
现代文：《无妄卦》的卦象是震下乾上，好比在天的下面有雷在运行之表象，象征着天用雷的威势警戒万物，并赋予万物以不妄动妄求的本性；从前的君主顺应天命，尽其所能地遵循天时以养育万物的生长。
English: The gaga of "Muwanggua" is like a tremor from the bottom to the top, like the appearance of thunder running under the sky. It symbolizes that the sky uses the power of thunder to warn all things, and gives all things the nature of not behaving recklessly. The former monarchs obeyed the fate of heaven and did their best to follow the time of day to nurture the growth of all things.

古文：无妄之药，不可试也。无妄之行，穷之灾也。
现代文： 不妄动妄求地前去行事 ，是说这样就可以实现志愿。 不在刚开始耕作时就期望立刻获得丰收 ，是说不企求获得非分的财富。
English: Not to act impulsively, that is to say, so that one can realize one's own will; not to expect an immediate harvest when one begins to cultivate, that is to say, not to seek to obtain undivided wealth.
