古文：雷风，恒；君子以立不易方。浚恒之凶，始求深也。
现代文：《恒卦》的卦象是巽下震上，为风雷交加之表象，二者常是相辅相成而不停地活动的形象，因而象征常久；君子效法这一现象，应当树立自身的形象，坚守常久不变的正道。
English: The gaga in "Heng Gua" is like the appearance of the wind and thunder under the armpit, and the two are often complementary and constantly active images, thus symbolizing eternity; a gentleman should emulate this phenomenon, establish his own image, and adhere to the eternal and unchanging right path.

古文：九二悔亡，能久中也。不恒其德，无所容也。
现代文：摇摆不定，不能坚守常久之道，但是又高高在上，终将一无所成，不会有所建树。
English: Unstable, unable to adhere to the eternal way, but high and mighty, will eventually achieve nothing, and will not build anything.
