古文：《易》之为书也，广大悉备。
现代文：《易经》这部书，凡天道、人道、地道，无所不包，可谓广大完备。
English: This book of "I Ching" is all-encompassing of the heavenly way, the humane way, and the earthly way, and can be described as vast and complete.

古文：有天道焉，有人道焉，有地道焉。兼三才而两之，故六。六者非它也，三材之道也。
现代文：易学以三划，象征天、人、地的三个位置，易理是相生相对，天有昼夜，地有水陆，人有男女，所以卦爻两两成列，合两个三爻的卦而为一个六爻的卦，兼两爻为一位，五为阳，上为阴，阴阳成象，故五与上为天位，三与四为人位，初与二为地位，为刚柔为形体。
English: Yi studies with three strokes, symbolizing the three positions of heaven, man, and earth. Yi theory is opposite to each other.

Therefore, the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of the three strokes of

古文：道有变动，故曰爻；爻有等，故曰物；物相杂，故曰文；文不当，故吉凶生焉。
现代文：六爻而成一卦，皆是相当于三才之道而已。《易经》之道，变动不居，而周流于六位之间的奇耦两画，称之为爻。爻有刚柔大小远近贵贱的等次，好像物类的不齐，所以称乾为阳，称坤为阴物。阴阳两物交相错杂，似青黄两色的相兼，所以称为文。
English: In the I Ching, there is no change, but the odd-couple pair of pictures that circulates between the six figures is called the "Wen." The "Wen" has a rigid and flexible size, and is far from noble and low-ranking, as if there is a disparity in species, so it is called the "Dry" and the "Yang," and the "Kun" is called the "Yin" and the "Yang." The "Yin" and the "Yang" are intertwined and mixed, like the combination of blue and yellow, so it is called the "Wen."
