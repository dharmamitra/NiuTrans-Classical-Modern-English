古文：《易》之为书也！不可远，为道也屡迁，变动不居，周流六虚，上下无常，刚柔相易，不可为典要，唯变所适。
现代文：《易经》这部书，是一部经世致用的学问，人生不可须臾疏远的，《易经》是以阴阳运行，互相推移变化的，故其道常常变迁，变动不拘于一爻一卦，如乾卦初九是潜龙，九二是见龙。
English: The "I Ching" is a book of knowledge that has been used throughout the ages. Life does not need to be estranged. The "I Ching" is based on yin and yang, and changes with each other. Therefore, its path often changes, and the changes do not depend on one gong and one gaga. For example, in the dry gaga, the first nine are hidden dragons, and the second nine are seen dragons.

古文：其出入以度，外内使知惧。
现代文：还有阴阳六爻，外三爻为上，内三爻为下，更互变动，周流于六个爻位之间，从上位降至下位，由下位升向上位，上下没有经常不变的爻位，阳刚阴柔，互相变易，在另一卦爻时，解释又不同，不可固执于一种典常，唯有观其变化的所往，才能周明其道。《易经》至理，启示我们出入进退，内外往来都要合于法度，或在外以安边定国，匡齐天下，或在内以正心诚意修身养性，皆使我们知道戒惧谨慎，以免除灾祸。
English: There is also a yin and yang hexagram, the outer hexagram is up, the inner hexagram is down, and they are even more interchanging. The cycle flows between the six hexagrams, from the higher to the lower, from the lower to the higher. There are no regularly unchanging hexagrams, the masculine and feminine are flexible and change with each other. In another hexagram, the interpretation is different, and it is not possible to stick to a norm. Only by observing its changing direction can we know its path. The "I Ching" is reasonable, and it reveals to us that we should go in and out, and that internal and external transactions must conform to the law, or

古文：又明于忧患与故。无有师保，如临父母。
现代文：同时，明瞭忧患的原因，虽无师保在旁，却似父母在自己面前，不致有过越颠损。
English: At the same time, they clearly understand the causes of their worries. Although they do not have a mentor, they are like parents in front of themselves, and they will not be overwhelmed.

古文：初率其辞而揆其方，既有典常。苟非其人，道不虚行。
现代文：最初遵循辞义以揆度爻象和道理所在，就有经常的法则，可让我们恪遵不二了。
English: In the first place, in following the dictum of moderation and reason, there is a constant law, which we must strictly observe.
