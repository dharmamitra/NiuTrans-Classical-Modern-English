古文：天地定位，山泽通气，雷风相薄，水火不相射，八卦相错，数往者顺，知来者逆；是故，易逆数也。
现代文：天与地确定了，上下的位置就定了，山与泽气息是相通的，雷与风相互接触，水与火可以相互融合不相射伤，八卦相互交错排列组合。数是定数，万物皆有定数定理一定的趋势，是过去的延伸；没有偶然发生的事情。
English: Heaven and earth are fixed, the position of the top and bottom is fixed, the mountain and the lake are connected, the thunder and the wind are in contact with each other, water and fire can be fused with each other without injury, and the eight trigrams are interlaced with each other. The number is a constant, everything has a constant theorem, a certain trend, is an extension of the past; there is no accidental occurrence.
