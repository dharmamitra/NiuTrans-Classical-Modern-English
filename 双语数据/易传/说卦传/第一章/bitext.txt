古文：昔者，圣人之作易也，幽赞神明而生蓍。参天两地而倚数，观变於阴阳，而立卦；发挥於刚柔，而生爻；和顺於道德，而理於义；穷理尽性，以至於命。
现代文：往昔圣人创制周易的时候，感叹自然的神奇现象之隐幽深邃，为了明于智慧，赞助万物；而创造出用蓍草为筹算，以数理的形式运算，感应自然，占筮的方法。大地是个平衡体，其道一阴一阳，数为偶为二；在二的上面在加一个天文的垂象，在天成象，在地成形，是为三，所以天数为三。
English: In the past, when sages created Zhouyi, they lamented the hiddenness and profundity of the miraculous phenomena of nature, in order to be clear to wisdom and support all things; and created a method of using ephemera as a calculation, operating in the form of mathematics, sensing nature, and occupying the cocoon. The earth is a balanced body, its path is yin and yang, the number is even two; on the top of two, an astronomical pendant is added, in the sky, in the earth, it is three, so the number of days is three.
