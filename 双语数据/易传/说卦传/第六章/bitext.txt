古文：神也者，妙万物而为言者也。
现代文：体知万物，不以思议测度，感而遂通万物之故曰神。阴阳不测之谓神。黄帝内经：心藏神。
English: God is said to be omniscient because he knows all things intimately and intuitively. God is said to be omnipresent because he knows all things intimately and intuitively. The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon: God is hidden in the heart.

古文：动万物者，莫疾乎雷；桡万物者，莫疾乎风；燥万物者，莫熯乎火；说万物者，莫说乎泽；润万物者，莫润乎水；终万物始万物者，莫盛乎艮。
现代文：又天生玄，玄生神。万物皆有神光，即万物是可知的，此神非鬼神之神，只是说明万物是可以认知的，非不可知。不可以知知者体也，可知者有形之下也。
English: All things are endowed with divine light, that is, all things are knowable. This god is not the god of ghosts and gods, but simply shows that all things are knowable, not unknowable. It is not possible to know the body of a knowable being, nor is it possible to know a knowable being under the form.

古文：故水火相逮，雷风不相悖，山泽通气，然后能变化，既成万物也。
现代文：所谓的神，是说体悟万物的奥妙，而正确简洁的描述事物。妙万物是客观，神是主观。
English: The so-called "god" means to understand the mystery of all things, and to describe things correctly and concisely. Wonderful things are objective, but God is subjective.
