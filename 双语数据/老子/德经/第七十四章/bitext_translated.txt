古文：民不畏死，奈何以死惧之？
现代文：如果人民饱受暴政的逼迫，到了连死都不怕反抗的时候，统治者又怎能用死来威胁到他们呢？
English: If the people are so oppressed by tyranny that they are not afraid to resist even unto death, how can the rulers threaten them with death?

古文：若使民常畏死，而为奇者，吾得执而杀之，孰敢？
现代文：假如人民真的畏惧死亡的话，对于为非作歹的人，我们就把他抓来杀掉，那还有谁敢胡作非为呢？
English: If the people really feared death, we would catch and kill anyone who did something wrong. Who else would dare to do something wrong?

古文：常有司杀者杀。夫代司杀者杀，是谓代大匠斲。夫代大匠斲者，希有不伤其手矣。
现代文：经常有专管杀人的人去执行杀人的任务，代替行戮者去杀人，就如同代替高明的木匠去砍木头，那代替高明的木匠砍木头的人，很少有不砍伤自已手指头的。
English: There are always killers to do the killing, to do the killing for the killers, just as there are carpenters to cut the wood for the carpenters, but few carpenters cut the wood for the carpenters without cutting their own fingers.
