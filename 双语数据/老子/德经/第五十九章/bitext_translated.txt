古文：治人事天，莫若嗇。
现代文：治理百姓、养护身心，没有比爱惜精力更为重要的了。
English: There is nothing more important for governing the people and protecting the mind and body than cherishing energy.

古文：夫为嗇，是谓早服；早服谓之重积德；重积德则无不克；无不克则莫知其极；莫知其极，可以有国；有国之母，可以长久；是谓深根固柢，长生久视之道。
现代文：爱惜精力，万事才能早做准备。早作准备，就是不断地积 德 ；不断地积 德 ，就没有什么不能攻克。没有什么不能攻克，那就无法估量他的力量。具备了这种无法估量的力量，就可以担负治理国家的重任。有了治理国家的原则和道理，国家就可以长久维持。这就是国家深根固柢，长生久视的道理。
English: Cherish energy, everything can be prepared early. To prepare early is to constantly accumulate virtue; to constantly accumulate virtue, there is nothing that cannot be overcome. If there is nothing that cannot be overcome, then his strength cannot be measured. With this immeasurable strength, you can shoulder the heavy responsibility of governing the country. With the principles and principles of governing the country, the country can be maintained for a long time. This is the reason why the country is deeply rooted and long-lived.
