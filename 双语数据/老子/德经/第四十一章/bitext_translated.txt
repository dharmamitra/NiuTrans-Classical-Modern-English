古文：上士闻道，勤而行之；中士闻道，若存若亡；下士闻道，大笑之。不笑不足以为道。
现代文：上士听了道的理论，勤恳、坚持不懈地去实行它；中士听了道的理论，半信半疑；下士听了道的理论，大笑不止，认为荒诞不稽。如果不被嘲笑，那就不足以成为道了。
English: The staff sergeant listened to the theory of the Tao and diligently and persistently practiced it; the sergeant listened to the theory of the Tao and half-believed; the corporal listened to the theory of the Tao and laughed and thought it was absurd. If it is not ridiculed, it is not enough to be a Tao.

古文：故建言有之：明道若昧，进道若退，夷道若颣。
现代文：因此古时立言的人说过这样的话：光明的道看似暗昧；前进的道好似后退；平坦的道好似崎岖。
English: That is why the ancients said: The bright road looks dark; the way forward looks backward; the smooth road looks rough.

古文：上德若谷，大白若辱，广德若不足，建德若偷，质真若渝；大方无隅；大器免成；大音希声；大象无形；道隐无名。
现代文：崇高的德好似低矮的山谷；最洁白的东西，反而含有污垢；广大的德好似有不足之处；刚健的德好似怠惰；质朴而纯真好像混浊未开。最方正的东西，反而没有棱角；最大的器具，反而最后完成；最大的声响，反而听来无声无息；最大的形象，反而没有形状。道幽隐而没有名称，无名无声。
English: The loftiest virtue is like a low valley; the whitest thing, on the contrary, contains dirt; the vast virtue seems to have shortcomings; the robust virtue is like laziness; the simple and pure seems to be muddy and unclear. The most square thing, on the contrary, has no corners; the largest appliance, on the contrary, is finally completed; the largest sound, on the contrary, sounds silent; the largest image, on the contrary, has no shape. The road is obscure and has no name, no name and no sound.

古文：夫唯道，善始且善成。
现代文：只有道使万物善始善终，而万物自始至终也离不开道。
English: Only the Way makes all things have a good beginning and a good ending, and all things are inseparable from the Way from beginning to end.
