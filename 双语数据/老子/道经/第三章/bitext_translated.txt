古文：不尚贤，使民不争；不贵难得之货，使民不为盗；不见可欲，使民心不乱。
现代文：如果社会不过分推崇贤才异能，那么老百姓就不会去争名逐利；不看重稀贵之物，就不会有偷窃的人；不显耀足以引起贪心的事物，就不会导致民心迷乱。
English: If society didn't over-praise talent and ability, then people wouldn't compete for fame and fortune; if they didn't value rare things, then there wouldn't be people who would steal; if things didn't shine brightly enough to cause greed, then it wouldn't lead to confusion in people's hearts.

古文：是以圣人之治，虚其心，实其腹；弱其志，强其骨。常使民无知无欲。
现代文：因此，圣人的治理原则是：使其心无所求，使其腹中有食物不致饥饿，使民志向符合自己的能力，使民坚韧自己的骨气。
English: Therefore, the governance principle of the sage is: let his heart have no desire, let his stomach have food without hunger, let the people's aspirations match their abilities, and let the people strengthen their backbone.

古文：使夫知者不敢为也。
现代文：即使民知道了也不敢知不敢要。
English: Even if the people knew, they would not dare to ask for it.

古文：为无为，则无不治。
现代文：做到无为，那么就不会治理不好国家。
English: If we do nothing, then there will be no bad governance of the country.
