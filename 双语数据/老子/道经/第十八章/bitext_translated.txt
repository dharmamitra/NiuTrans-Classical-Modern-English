古文：大道废，有仁义；智慧出，有大伪；六亲不和，有孝慈；国家昏乱，有忠臣。
现代文：大道的荒废，人们才开始推崇和赞扬仁义道德；聪明智巧的现象出现，才会产生虚伪狡诈；家庭的不和睦，才能显示出孝与慈；国家陷于混乱，才会出现忠臣。
English: It is only when the streets are deserted that people begin to respect and praise benevolence, righteousness, and morality; it is only when clever and skillful phenomena appear that hypocrisy and cunning arise; it is only when there is discord in the family that filial piety and mercy can be shown; and it is only when the country is in chaos that loyal subjects appear.
