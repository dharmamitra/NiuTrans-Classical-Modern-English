古文：故有无相生，难易相成，长短相形，高下相倾，音声相和，前后相随，恒也。
现代文：因为事物都是互相对立而出现的，所以有和无由互相对立而诞生，难和易由互相对立而形成，长和短由互相对立而体现，高和下由互相对立而存在，音和声由互相对立而和谐，前和后由互相对立而出现。
English: Because things all appear in opposition to each other, existence and non-existence are born in opposition to each other, difficult and easy are formed in opposition to each other, long and short are reflected in opposition to each other, high and low exist in opposition to each other, sound and harmony are in harmony in opposition to each other, and front and back appear in opposition to each other.

古文：是以圣人处无为之事，行不言之教，万物作焉而不辞，生而不有，为而不恃，功成而弗居。
现代文：这是永远不变的一一恒。因此圣人用无为的观点对待世事，用不言的方式施行教化：听任万物自然兴起而不拒绝他们，生养了万物而不占有，不加自己的倾向，功成业就而不自居。
English: This is a constancy that never changes. Therefore, sages approach the world from the perspective of non-action, and carry out enlightenment in an unspoken manner: let all things arise naturally without rejecting them, give birth to and nurture all things without possessing them, and do not add their own inclinations. Accomplishments are not self-serving.

古文：夫唯弗居，是以不去。
现代文：正是因为不居功，所以功绩才不会泯灭
English: It is because merit is not given that merit is not destroyed
