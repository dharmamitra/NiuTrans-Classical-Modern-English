古文：有物混成，先天地生，寂兮寥兮，独立而不改，周行而不殆，可以为天地母。
现代文：有一个东西混然而成，在天地形成以前就已经存在。听不到它的声音也看不见它的形体，寂静而空虚，不依靠任何外力而独立长存永不停息，循环运行而永不衰竭，可以作为万物的根本。
English: There is a thing that came into being spontaneously, existed before the formation of heaven and earth. Its sound cannot be heard and its form cannot be seen. It is silent and empty. It does not rely on any external force but exists independently and never stops. It runs in cycles and never runs out. It can be regarded as the basis of all things.

古文：吾不知其名，强字之曰道，强为之名曰大。
现代文：我不知道它的名字，所以勉强把它叫做 道 ，再勉强给它起个名字叫做 大 。

古文：大曰逝，逝曰远，远曰反。
现代文：它广大无边而运行不息，运行不息而伸展遥远，伸展遥远而又返回本原。
English: It is vast and boundless, but it never stops moving. It never stops moving, but it stretches far away. It stretches far away, but it returns to its original place.

古文：故道大，天大，地大，人亦大。
现代文：所以说道大、天大、地大、人也大。
English: That's why we say big, big in the sky, big in the earth, and big in people.

古文：域中有四大，而人居其一焉。

English: Among these four, people live and work and reproduce according to the earth; the earth alternates between cold and hot according to the heavens, and nurtures all things; natural climate and celestial changes follow the course of the universe; and the road is based on the nature of nature and follows its natural course.
