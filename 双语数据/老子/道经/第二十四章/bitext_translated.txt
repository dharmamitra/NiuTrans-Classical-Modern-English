古文：企者不立；跨者不行；自见者不明；自是者不彰；自伐者无功；自矜者不长。
现代文：踮起脚尖想要站得更高，反而站不稳；迈着大步想走得更快一些，反而走不远。局限于自己所见，就看不明白；以自己为对，就遮蔽真相；经常自我夸耀反而没有功劳，自以为自高自大反而不能被认可并获得尊重。
English: Standing on tiptoes to stand higher, but not stable; striding to walk faster, but not far; limited to what you see, you can't understand; taking yourself as right, you cover up the truth; often self-boasting but no merit, self-righteous arrogance but can't be recognized and respected.

古文：其在道也，曰余食赘形，物或恶之，故有道者不处。
现代文：从 道 的角度衡量，以上这些急躁炫耀的行为，只能说是剩饭赘瘤。因为它们是令人厌恶的东西，所以有道的人决不这样做。
English: Judged from the perspective of Tao, the above-mentioned impetuous and ostentatious behaviors can only be said to be leftovers. Because they are disgusting things, people with Tao will never do this.
