古文：重为轻根，静为躁君。
现代文：厚重是轻率的根本，静定是躁动的主宰。
English: Thickness and weight are the root of imprudence, and static stability is the master of agitation.

古文：是以君子终日行不离輜重，虽有荣观，燕处超然，奈何万乘之主，而以身轻天下？
现代文：因此君子终日行走，不离开载装行李的车辆，即使有奢华的享受，他也漠然处之，从不沉溺其中。为什么有万乘之车的大国君主，还轻率躁动以治天下呢？
English: For this reason, a gentleman walks all day long, never leaving the vehicle in which he carries his luggage. Even if he enjoys luxury, he is indifferent to it and never indulges in it. Why do the monarchs of great countries, who have cars for thousands of passengers, still act rashly in order to rule the world?

古文：轻则失根，躁则失君。
现代文：轻率就会失去根本；急躁就会丧失主导。
English: Light-heartedness will lose its foundation; impatience will lose its dominance.
