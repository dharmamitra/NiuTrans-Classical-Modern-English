古文：武王问太公曰： 引兵深入诸侯之地，主将欲合兵行无穷之变，图不测之利，其事繁多，符不能明，相去辽远，言语不通，为之奈何？ 
现代文：武王问太公说： 率领军队深入敌国境内，国君与主将想要集结兵力，根据敌情进行灵活的机动，出其不意的战胜敌军。然而情况复杂，用阴符难以说明问题，彼此相距又十分遥远，言语难通。在这种情况下应该怎么办？ 
English: King Wu asked the Grand Duke, "When leading an army deep into the enemy's territory, the sovereign and the commander-in-chief want to gather forces, flexibly maneuver according to the enemy's situation, and unexpectedly defeat the enemy. However, the situation is complex, it is difficult to explain the problem with Yin symbols, the distance between each other is very far, and it is difficult to communicate. What should we do in this situation?"

古文：太公曰： 诸有阴事大虑，当用书，不用符，主以书遗将，将以书问主，书皆一合而再离，三发而一知。
现代文：太公回答道： 所有密谋大计，都应当用阴书，而不用阴符。国君用阴书向主将传达指示，主将用阴书向国君请示问题，这种阴书都是一合而再离、三发而一知。
English: The Grand Duke replied, "All conspiracies should be carried out using yin letters, not yin symbols. The sovereign should use yin letters to convey instructions to the commander in chief, and the commander in chief should use yin letters to ask questions of the sovereign. These kinds of yin letters should be sent one after the other.

古文：再离者，分书为三部；三发而一知者，言三人，人操一分，相参而不知情也。此谓阴书，敌虽圣智，莫知能识。 武王曰： 善哉！ 
现代文：所谓一合而再离，就是把一封书信分为三个部分；所谓三发而一知，就是派三个人送信，每人只拿着其中的一部分，必须相互参照才知道内容，否则即使送信的人也不知道书信的内容，这就叫阴书。这样，无论敌人怎样聪明，也不能识破我的秘密。 武王说： 高明啊！ 
English: The so-called "one-in-one-out" is to divide a letter into three parts; the so-called "three-out-one-in" is to send three people to send a letter. Each person only holds a part of it, and they must refer to each other to know the content. Otherwise, even the sender does not know the content of the letter, which is called a "ghost letter." In this way, no matter how clever the enemy is, they cannot see through my secret. King Wu said: How clever!
