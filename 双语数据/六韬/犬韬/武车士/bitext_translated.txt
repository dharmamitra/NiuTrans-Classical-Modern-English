古文：太公曰： 选车士之法：取年四十以下，长七尺五寸以上，走能逐奔马，及驰而乘之，前后左右、上下周旋、能束缚旌旗；力能彀八石弩，射前后左右，皆便习者，名曰武车之士，不可不厚也。 
现代文：太公答道： 选拔战车上的武士的标准是：选取年龄在四十岁以下、身高七尺五寸以上；跑起来能追得上奔跑的马，能在奔跑中跳上战车；并能在战车上前后、左右、上下各方应战，能执掌旌旗，力能拉开八石的强弓，能娴熟地向前后左右的敌人射箭的人。这样的人才称得上战车武士，对他们不可不给予优厚待遇。 
English: Taiko replied, "The criteria for selecting a samurai on a chariot are as follows: Those who are under the age of forty and over seven feet five inches tall; those who can catch a running horse when running, and can jump onto a chariot while running; and those who can fight in front, behind, to the right, and up and down on a chariot; those who can hold a banner; those who can pull a strong eight-stone bow; and those who can skillfully shoot arrows at enemies around and behind. Such people are called chariot samurai, and they must be given preferential treatment.
