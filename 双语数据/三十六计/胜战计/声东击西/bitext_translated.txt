古文：敌志乱萃，不虞。坤下兑上之象，利其不自主而取之。
现代文：敌人乱撞瞎碰，不能正确预料和应付事变和复杂局面，正如坤下兑上的萃卦受到扰乱一样，必须利用敌方失去控制力的时机给以消灭。
English: If the enemy is confused, unable to correctly anticipate and deal with incidents and complex situations, just as Kun's counterattack was disrupted, it is necessary to take advantage of the enemy's loss of control to eliminate it.
