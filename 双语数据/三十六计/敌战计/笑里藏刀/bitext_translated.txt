古文：信而安之，阴以图之。备而后动，勿使有变。
现代文：表面上要做得使敌人深信不疑，从而对我方不加戒备；我方则暗中策划，充分准备，一有机会就立即动手，不让敌人有应变的时机。
English: On the surface, we should do our best to convince the enemy beyond any doubt, so that they will not be wary of us; on the other hand, we should secretly plan, fully prepare, and take immediate action at the first opportunity to prevent the enemy from having time to prepare.

古文：刚中柔外也。
现代文：这就是外表上柔和，骨子里却要刚强的谋略。
