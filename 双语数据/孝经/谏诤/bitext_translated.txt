古文：曾子曰： 若夫慈爱、恭敬、安亲、扬名，则闻命矣。敢问子从父之令，可谓孝乎？ 
现代文：曾子说： 像慈爱、恭敬、安亲、扬名这些孝道，已经听过了天子的教诲，我想再冒昧地问一下，做儿子的一味遵从父亲的命令，就可称得上是孝顺了吗？ 
English: Zeng Zi said, "Such filial piety as loving kindness, respect, being kind to relatives, and making a name for oneself have already heard the teachings of the heavenly son. I would like to venture to ask again, as a son, if you just follow your father's orders, can you be called filial?

古文：子曰： 是何言与，是何言与！
现代文：孔子说： 这是甚么话呢？这是甚么话呢？
English: Confucius said, "What is this saying? What is this saying?"

古文：昔者天子有争臣七人，虽无道，不失其天下；诸侯有争臣五人，虽无道，不失其国；大夫有争臣三人，虽无道，不失其家；士有争友，则身不离于令名；父有争子，则身不陷于不义。
现代文：从前，天子身边有个直言相谏的诤臣，因此，纵使天子是个无道昏君，他也不会失去其天下；诸侯有直言谏争的诤臣五人，即便自己是个无道君主，也不会失去他的诸侯国地盘；卿大夫也有三位直言劝谏的臣属，所以即使他是个无道之臣，也不会失去自己的家园。普通的读书人有直言劝争的朋友，自己的美好名声就不会丧失；为父亲的有敢于直言力争的儿子，就能使父亲不会陷身于不义之中。
English: Once upon a time, there was an outspoken vassal around Tianzi. Therefore, even if Tianzi was a dissolute ruler, he would not lose his world; five vassals of princes who had outspoken disputes, even if he was a dissolute monarch, would not lose his vassal territory; Sir Doctor also had three outspoken vassals, so even if he was a dissolute vassal, he would not lose his home. Ordinary readers have outspoken friends, and their good reputation will not be lost; for a father who has a son who dares to speak out, he can prevent his father from falling into injustice.

古文：故当不义，则子不可以不争于父，臣不可以不争于君；故当不义，则争之。
现代文：因此在遇到不义之事时，如系父亲所为，做儿子的不可以不劝争力阻；如系君王所为，做臣子的不可以不直言谏争。所以对于不义之事，一定要谏争劝阻。
English: Therefore, when encountering injustice, if it is the act of a father, a son must not fail to persuade and dissuade; if it is the act of a monarch, a vassal must not fail to speak out and dissuade. Therefore, for injustice, we must fight and dissuade.

古文：从父之令，又焉得为孝乎！ 
现代文：如果只是遵从父亲的命令，又怎么称得上是孝顺呢？ 
English: If you just follow your father's orders, how can you call it filial piety?
