古文：子曰： 君子之事上也，进思尽忠，退思补过，将顺其美，匡救其恶，故上下能相亲也。
现代文：孔子说： 君子奉事君王，在朝廷为官的时候，要想看如何竭尽其忠心；退官居家的时候，要想看如何补救君王的过失。对于君王的优点，要顺应发扬；对于君王的过失缺点，要匡正补救，所以君臣关系才能够相互亲敬。
English: Confucius said: A gentleman should serve the king, and when serving in the imperial court, he should see how to fulfill his loyalty; when retiring from office and living at home, he should see how to remedy the king's faults. For the king's merits, he should promote them; for the king's faults and shortcomings, he should rectify and remedy them, so that the relationship between the monarch and the subjects can be mutually respectful.

古文：《诗》云： 心乎爱矣，遐不谓矣，中心藏之，何日忘之。  
现代文：《诗经·小雅·隰桑》篇中说： 心中充溢着爱敬的情怀，无论多么遥远，这片真诚的爱心永久藏在心中，从不会有忘记的那一天。  
English: "The heart is filled with feelings of love and respect, no matter how far away, this sincere love is forever hidden in the heart, and there will never be a day to forget.
