古文：子曰： 君子之事亲孝，故忠可移于君。事兄悌，故顺可移于长。居家理，故治可移于官。
现代文：孔子说： 君子侍奉父母亲能尽孝，所以能把对父母的孝心移作对国君的忠心；奉事兄长能尽敬，所以能把这种尽敬之心移作对前辈或上司的敬顺；在家里能处理好家务，所以会把理家的道理移于做官治理国家。
English: Confucius said: A gentleman can serve his parents with filial piety, so he can transfer the filial piety of his parents to the loyalty of the sovereign; he can serve his elder brother with respect, so he can transfer this respect to his predecessors or superiors; he can handle the housework well at home, so he will transfer the principle of managing the house to being an official and governing the country.

古文：是以行成于内，而名立于后世矣。 
现代文：因此说能够在家里尽孝悌之道、治理好家政的人，其名声也就会显扬于后世了。 
English: Therefore, it is said that a person who is able to fulfill filial piety at home and manage household affairs well will have a good reputation in the future.
