古文：所谓致知在格物者，言欲致吾之知，在即物而穷其理也。
现代文：所说的 致知在格物 ，说的是要让自己知晓达到一种极致的程度，就必须接触事物并且彻底研究事物的道理。
English: What is meant by "getting to know what is in the box" is that in order to get to know oneself to an extreme degree, it is necessary to come into contact with things and thoroughly study the principles of things.

古文：盖人心之灵莫不有知，而天下之物莫不有理，唯于理有未穷，故其知有不尽也，是以《大学》始教，必使学者即凡天下之物，莫不因其已知之理而益穷之，以求至乎其极。
现代文：人的心灵都具有认识能力，而天下万事万物都总有一定的原理，只不过因为这些原理还没有被彻底认识，所以使知识显得很有局限。因此，《大学》一开始就教学习者接触天下万事万物，用自己已有的知识去进一步探究，以彻底认识万事万物的原理。
English: The human mind has the ability to understand, and everything in the world always has a certain principle, but because these principles have not yet been fully understood, knowledge appears to be very limited. Therefore, "University" from the beginning teaches learners to contact everything in the world and use their existing knowledge to further explore in order to fully understand the principles of everything.

古文：至于用力之久，而一旦豁然贯通焉，则众物之表里精粗无不到，而吾心之全体大用无不明矣。此谓物格，此谓知之至也。
现代文：经过长期用功，总有一天会豁然贯通，到那时，万事万物的里外巨细都被认识得清清楚楚，而自己内心的一切认识能力都得到淋漓尽致的发挥，再也没有蔽塞。
English: After long-term hard work, one day it will suddenly be penetrated. At that time, the internal and external dimensions of everything will be clearly recognized, and all the cognitive abilities of one's own heart will be fully exerted, and there will be no more obstruction.
