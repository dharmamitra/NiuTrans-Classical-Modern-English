古文：赵广汉之死由魏相，韩延寿之死由萧望之。魏、萧贤公卿也，忍以其私陷二材臣于死地乎？
现代文：西汉时，大臣赵广汉向以执法不遵权贵著械后来却被杀，这事与魏相有关；曾任颖川、东郡太守的韩延寿，也是政绩卓著，后来也被诬陷身死，这又与萧望之有关。魏相、萧望之都是非常贤明的公卿大臣，怎么会忍心以个人的恩怨把二位有才能的贤臣里于死地呢？
English: During the Western Han Dynasty, the minister Zhao Guanghan was killed because he did not obey the law, but this was related to Wei Xiang; Han Yan Shou, who was once appointed governor of Yingchuan and Dong County, also had outstanding political achievements, and was later framed for his death, which was also related to Xiao Wang. Wei Xiang and Xiao Wang are both very wise noble ministers. How could they bear to kill two talented wise ministers with personal grudges?

古文：杨恽坐语言怨望，而廷尉当以大逆不道。以其时考之，乃于定国也。史称定国为延尉，民自以不冤，岂其然乎？
现代文：杨恽也是一位为朝廷立过大功劳的大臣，他因为被免为庶人后，竟因给友人写信时说了儿句牢骚话，就被掌别狱的廷尉认为是大逆不道，判处以斩刑。这个廷尉又恰恰是于定国，历史上曾经称道于定国为廷尉、民间就没有冤案了，果真是如此吗？
English: Yang Xuan was also a minister who had rendered great services to the imperial court. After he was released from being a commoner, he was sentenced to beheading by the imperial lieutenant who was in charge of the prison because he wrote a childish complaint to a friend. The imperial lieutenant thought that this was a great treason and sentenced him to be beheaded. This imperial lieutenant was precisely Yu Dingguo. Historically, Yu Dingguo had been praised as an imperial lieutenant, and the people had no grievances. Is this really so?

古文：宣帝治尚严，而三人者，又从而辅翼之，为可恨也？
现代文：并不尽然，以宣帝时法制很严，而魏相、萧望之、于定国三人又是辅佐皇帝的得力大臣，也曾有过这类失误，实在是天大的遗憾。
English: It is not entirely true that the legal system was very strict at the time of Emperor Xuan, and Wei Xiang, Xiao Wangzhi, and Yu Dingguo, three powerful ministers who assisted the emperor, also had such mistakes, which is really a great pity.
