古文：严州本名睦州，宣各中以方寇之故改焉。
现代文：严州本来的名字叫睦州。北宋宣和年间因为方腊起义的原因改为严州。
English: The original name of Yanzhou was Muzhou. During the Northern Song Dynasty, it was changed to Yanzhou because of the Fangla Uprising.

古文：虽以威严为义，然实取严陵滩之意也。
现代文：之所以改为严州，虽然也有表示威严的意思，实际上则是因为东汉严光避居之地严陵滩在此地，所以才如此改的。
English: The reason why it was changed to Yanzhou, although it also had the meaning of majesty, was actually because Yanling Beach, a place of refuge for the Eastern Han Dynasty, was located here, so it was changed.

古文：殊不考子陵乃庄氏，东汉避显宗讳，以 庄 为 严 ，故史家追书以为严光，后世当从实可也。
现代文：其实，大家并未认真考究，严光姓庄，东汉时汉显宗孝明皇帝的名字叫刘庄，严家为避其讳，把 庄 字改为 严 字。于是史学家的就写成了严光，后代的人应该实事求是地对待这件事。
English: In fact, people did not seriously study the matter. Yan Guang's family name was Zhuang. In the Eastern Han Dynasty, the name of Emperor Han Xianzong Xiaoming was Liu Zhuang. In order to avoid it, the Yan family changed the Zhuang character to the Yan character. Therefore, historians wrote it as Yan Guang. Future generations should treat this matter realistically.
