古文：使二公真践此言，时得洒扫撰杖屦于其侧，所谓不二法门，不传之妙，启聪击蒙，出肤寸之泽以润千里者，可胜道哉！
现代文：假使二位大诗人真的实践了这句话，其时大家奉其旁，或洒扫庭除，或撰杖捧展，即可听到他们所谈的为诗为文的不二法门、不传之秘，启迪器明，打破蒙昧，其得益当非浅鲜，就象云气出山弥漫千里润泽天下一样，哪能说得尽呢？
English: If the two great poets had really put these words into practice, when everyone stood by their side, or swept the yard, or held out their canes, we could hear what they were talking about as the unique method of poetry as a text, the secrets that are not passed on, the enlightenment, and the breaking of obscurities. Their benefits should not be shallow, just like the clouds coming out of the mountains permeate thousands of miles and moisturize the world. How can I say it all?
