古文：汉高祖用韩信为大将，而三以诈临之：信既定赵，高祖自成皋度河，晨自称汉使驰入信壁，信未起，即其卧，夺其印符，麾召诸将易置之；项羽死，则又袭夺其军；卒之伪游云梦而缚信。
现代文：汉高祖任用韩信作为大将，知三次用诈术对付他：韩信平定赵地之后，高祖从成皋渡过黄河，一大早自称汉王使节飞马驰入韩信军营，韩信尚未起床，进入他的卧室收取他的印信符节，用大将的旗帜召来将领们，改变了他们的职位；项羽死后，再次用突然袭击的方式收取韩信的军权；最后假托巡游云梦而捉拿了韩信。
English: Han Gaozhu appointed Han Xin as a general and used trickery to deal with him three times: After Han Xin conquered Zhao Di, Gaozhu crossed the Yellow River from Chengdu to Chengdu. Early in the morning, he claimed to be the envoy of the Han King and galloped into Han Xin's military camp. Han Xin had not yet got up, entered his bedroom to receive his seal, called the generals with the general's flag, and changed their positions. After Xiang Yu's death, he once again used surprise attacks to seize Han Xin's military power. Finally, he caught Han Xin by pretending to be on a cruise.

古文：夫以豁达大度开基之主，所行乃如是，信之终于谋逆，盖有以启之矣。
现代文：凭着一个豁达大度的开国君主的身份，所作所为竟然如此，韩信终于图谋叛乱，看来萌生这种念头是有原因的。
English: With the status of an open-minded and generous founding monarch, Han Xin finally plotted a rebellion. It seems that there is a reason for this idea.
