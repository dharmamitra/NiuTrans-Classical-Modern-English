古文：其后各以五万骑深入，去病益封五千八百户，裨校封候益邑者六人，而青不得益封，吏卒无封者。武帝赏功，必视法如何，不以贵贱为高下，其明白如此。
现代文：其后，二人各率五万骑兵深入匈奴腹地。霍去病增加封赠五千八百户，偏将，校尉被封侯增加食邑的共六人，而卫青没有得到增加封赠，手下的吏卒没有得到封赠，汉武帝论功行赏，必定按法进行，不以贵贱论高下，如此圣明。

Ho went to the disease to increase the gift of five thousand and eight hundred households, a total of six people, including the general and the captain, were given additional food villages, while Wei Qing did not receive an increase in the gift of the seal, and his subordinates did not receive the gift of the seal.

English: Future generations will surely say of this: "Wei Qingjiu was a general for a long time, and he risked his life to serve. Even if he did not receive a large reward, he should have done something to comfort the hearts of his soldiers. If he did not, he would not have been able to motivate his soldiers, and there was probably something improper about it.
