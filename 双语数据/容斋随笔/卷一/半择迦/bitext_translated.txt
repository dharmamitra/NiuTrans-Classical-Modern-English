古文：《大般若经》云：梵言 扇搋半择迦 ，唐言黄门，其类有五：一曰半择迦，总名也，有男根用而不生子；二曰伊利沙半择迦，此云妒，谓他行欲即发，不见即无，亦具男根而不生子；三曰扇搋半择迦，谓本来男根不满，亦不能生子；四曰博义半择迦，谓半月能男，半月不能男；五曰留拿半择迦，此云割，谓被割刑者。
现代文：《大般若经》上说：古印度人说 扇搋半择迦 ，汉语翻译过来叫黄门的意思，种类有五样：一种叫半择迦，是总名，指的是男根能用却不能生小孩；其二叫伊利沙半择迦，汉语叫妒，说男人做欲事就要射了，突然阳瘘射不出，也是有男根却不能生小孩；其三叫扇搋半择迦，说的是男根没有发育完全，也不能生小孩；其四叫博义半择迦，是半月能做男事半月又不能做男事的人；其五叫留拿半择迦，这种我们叫 阉割 ，是说这种人被用 腐刑 割掉了男根。
