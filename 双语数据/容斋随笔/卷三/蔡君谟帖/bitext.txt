古文：蔡君谟一帖云： 襄昔之为谏臣，与今之为词臣，一也，为谏臣有言责，世人自见疏，今无是焉，世人见亲，襄之于人，未始异之，而人之观故有以异也。 
现代文：蔡君读有一个贴子说： 我过去当谏官，与今天当词臣、是一样的，当谏官有批评弹勤的责任，人们自然和我疏远，现在没有这个责任了，人们就和我亲近，我的为人，没有两样，而是人们对我的看法有两种。 
English: Cai Jun read a post that said: I used to be a eunuch, and today I am a eunuch, is the same. When a eunuch has the responsibility of criticizing the performance, people naturally alienate me. Now that I don't have this responsibility, people are close to me. I am no different, but people have two opinions of me.

古文：观此帖，乃知昔时居台谏者，为人所疏如此。今则反是，方为此官时，其门挥汗成雨，一徙他局，可张爵罗，风俗偷薄甚矣。
现代文：看了此帖，才知道在御史台当谏官的被人如此地疏远，现在却翻了过来，当他刚任谏官时，门外车马拥挤不动，一旦换了别的官，门外就能支鸟网，人情薄的是太厉害了。
English: After reading this post, I came to know that the eunuch at the Imperial Household Agency was so alienated by people, but now it has turned around. When he was first appointed as eunuch, the cars and horses outside the door were crowded and did not move. Once he was replaced by another official, a bird net could be propped up outside the door. It is too terrible to be so unfriendly.

古文：又有送荔枝与昭文相公一帖云： 襄再拜，宿来伏惟台候起居万福。
现代文：他又有送荔枝给昭文相公一个贴子，说： 我再三致意，近来想你一切顺适。
English: He also sent litchi to Akifumi, saying, "I have repeatedly sent my regards, and I hope everything is going well for you recently.

古文：闽中荔枝，唯陈家紫号为第一，辄献左右，以伸野芹之诚，幸赐收纳，谨奉手状上闻不宣。襄上昭文相公阁下。 
现代文：闽中的荔枝，惟有陈家紫最好，现在送上，用以表现野人献芹的诚意，希望收下，敬上此书，不复一一，此上昭文相公阁下。 
English: The litchi in the urn, only the Chen family purple is the best, is now sent to the urn to show the sincerity of the wild man's offering, I hope to receive it, respectfully submit this book, do not repeat one by one, this is your Excellency Mr. Akifumi.

古文：是时，侍从与宰相往还，其礼盖如是，今之不情苛礼，吁可厌哉！
现代文：当时侍从官和宰相往来、礼节就是这样，现在不近人情，礼节甚严，真是讨厌啊！
English: At that time, the etiquette between the attendants and the prime minister was like this, but now it's inhumane, the etiquette is very strict, it's really disgusting!
