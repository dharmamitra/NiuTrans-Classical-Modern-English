古文：《屯》、《蒙》二卦，皆二阳而四阴，《屯》以六二乘初九之刚，《蒙》以六三乘九二之刚。
现代文：《屯卦》、《蒙卦》两卦的卦象，都是两个阳爻四个阴爻，《屯卦》的六二的爻位在初九之上，呈阴柔凌驾阳刚之象；《蒙卦》的六三在九二之上，也呈阴柔凌乘阳刚之象。
English: "Tun Gua" and "Mong Gua" both have two impotent deities and four masculine deities. The 62nd deity of "Tun Gua" is above the 9th deity, representing the feminine dominating the masculine; the 63rd deity of "Mong Gua" is above the 92nd deity, also representing the feminine dominating the masculine.

古文：而《屯》之爻曰： 女子贞不字，十年乃字 ，《蒙》之爻曰： 勿用取女，见金夫，不有躬 ，其正邪不同如此者，盖《屯》二居中得正，不为初刚所诱，而上从九五，所以为贞。
现代文：但是《屯卦》的爻辞说； 女子贞洁，不生育，十年才生育 ；《蒙卦》的义辞却说： 不要娶女子，她见到丈夫的财物，丈夫会没有自身的 ；它们的正直和奸邪是这样的不同。《屯卦》的二义在下卦位里处在中间，得到中正，不受初爻的阳刚诱惑，而且在上外位里是九五，上下卦位阴阳都处在中间，相互呼应，这就是贞洁的道理。
English: However, the aphorism of "Tun Gua" says: a woman is chaste and does not give birth, and it takes ten years to give birth; the aphorism of "Mong Gua" says: do not marry a woman, if she sees her husband's wealth, her husband will not have his own; their honesty and adultery are so different. The second meaning of "Tun Gua" is in the middle in the lower Gua position, to get the middle is right, not to be tempted by the masculine temptation of the first son, and in the upper outer position is nine five, and the yin and yang of the upper and lower Gua position are in the middle

古文：《蒙》三不中不正，见九二之阳，悦而下从之，而舍上九之正应，所以勿用。
现代文：《蒙卦》的三爻不在卦体的正中，见到九二的阳刚之象，就喜悦地向下跟随着它，而舍弃了与上九的正当呼应，这就是不要娶的道理。
English: In "Mongga," the Three Storks are not in the middle of the body. When you see the masculine figure of the Ninety-two, you will happily follow it downwards, abandoning the rightful echo of the Upper Nine. This is the reason why you should not marry.

古文：士之守身居世，而择所从所处，尚监兹哉！
现代文：士人自守信守节、处身处世，选择跟随的对象、处世的方法，还要借鉴于这些道理呀！
English: These principles should also be taken into account when a scholar observes the Day of Faith, lives in the world, chooses whom to follow and how to live in the world.
