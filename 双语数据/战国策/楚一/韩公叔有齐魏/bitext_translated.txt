古文：韩公叔有齐、魏，而太子有楚、秦以争国。郑申为楚使于韩，矫以新城，阳人予太子。
现代文：韩国公叔有齐、魏两国的支持，太子几瑟有楚、秦两国的支持，两个各有所恃，便互相争夺太子之位。
English: Korea's father-in-law had the support of Qi and Wei, while Prince Kisei had the support of Chu and Qin, and the two fought for the position of prince.

古文：楚王怒，将罪之。对曰： 臣矫予之，以为国也。臣为太子得新城、阳人，以与公叔争国而得之。
现代文：郑申为楚国出使出韩国，他假托楚王之命把新城、阳人两地许给了几瑟，楚王很生气，要惩处郑申。郑申禀报说： 我假传王命，把新城、阳人许给几瑟，全是为了楚国的利益。
English: Zheng Shen was dispatched to Korea for the state of Chu. He falsely promised the two provinces of Xincheng and Yangren to Kise on behalf of the king of Chu. The king of Chu was very angry and wanted to punish Zheng Shen. Zheng Shen reported: I falsely preached the king's command and promised Xincheng and Yangren to Kise, all for the benefit of the state of Chu.

古文：齐、魏必伐韩。韩氏急，必悬命于楚，又何新城、阳人之敢求?
现代文：我为几瑟取得了新城、阳人两地，这是为他与公叔争夺太子权位而谋取的，齐、魏两国得知必定会出兵进攻韩国，韩国紧急，必定会完全依靠楚国去救援，又有谁敢要求新城、阳人两地呢？
English: I obtained Xincheng and Yangren for him. This was for him to compete with his uncle for the position of crown prince. The two countries of Qi and Wei learned that they would certainly send troops to attack South Korea. South Korea was in an emergency and would certainly rely entirely on the state of Chu for rescue. Who would dare to demand Xincheng and Yangren?

古文：太子不胜，然而不死，今将倒冠而至，又安敢言地? 楚王曰： 善。 
现代文：如果几瑟不能战胜齐、魏，侥幸活着，肯定会仓皇逃奔到楚国来，又怎么敢提起新城、阳人的事呢？ 楚王说： 好 。
English: If Kese could not defeat Qi and Wei, and if he was lucky enough to be alive, he would certainly flee to Chu in a hurry. How dare he bring up the matter of Xincheng and Yangren? King Chu said, "Good."

古文：乃不罪也。
现代文：就不再惩处郑申了。
English: They will no longer punish Zheng Sheng.
