古文：秦欲攻周，周最谓秦王曰： 为王之国计者，不攻周。攻周，实不足以利国，而声畏天下。
现代文：秦国打算进攻西周，周最对秦王说： 大王真的为国家利益着想的话，就不该攻打西周，秦如果攻打西周，对秦国毫无益处，反而会在各诸侯国之间把名声搞臭，为天下诸侯所唾弃。
English: Qin intended to attack Western Zhou, and Zhou said to the Qin king: "If the great king is really thinking about the interests of the country, he should not attack Western Zhou. If Qin attacks Western Zhou, it will be of no benefit to Qin. On the contrary, it will stink up the reputation among the various vassal states and will be spurned by the vassals of the world."

古文：天下以声畏秦，必东合于齐。
现代文：到时诸侯们将不再联合秦，反而与东边和齐联合。
English: At that time, the lords will no longer unite with Qin, but will instead unite with Dongbian and Qi.

古文：兵弊于周，而合天下于齐，则秦孤而不王矣。
现代文：秦为攻周陷于疲惫，天下诸侯联合了齐国，那么秦国就不能称霸诸侯了。
English: Qin fell into exhaustion for attacking Zhou, and the world's princes united with Qi, so Qin could no longer dominate the princes.

古文：是天下欲罢秦，故劝王攻周。
现代文：可见攻周一事，完全是诸侯们为了使秦军精疲力尽，才怂恿君王干的。
English: It can be seen that the attack was entirely the result of the lords trying to exhaust the Qin army.

古文：秦与天下惧罢，则令不横行于周矣。 
现代文：当秦国和天下诸侯们的实力都消耗尽了，那么任何国家的号令都不能通行于周了。 
English: When the power of Qin and the princes of the world is exhausted, then the call of any country can not pass through Zhou.
