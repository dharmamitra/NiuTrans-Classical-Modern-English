古文：秦，大国也。
现代文：秦是大国，韩是小国。
English: Qin is a big country, Han is a small country.

古文：韩，小国也。韩甚疏秦。然而见亲秦，计之，非金无以也，故卖美人。
现代文：韩国对秦国很疏远，但是表面上又不得表现出跟秦国很亲近，考虑到非用钱财不可，所以就出售美女。
English: South Korea is very distant from Qin, but on the surface it is not allowed to show that it is very close to Qin. Considering that it is necessary to use money, it sells beautiful women.

古文：美人之贾贵，诸侯不能买，故秦买之三干金。
现代文：美女的价钱昂贵，诸侯都买不起，后来秦王花了三千金把美女买了下来。
English: The price of a beautiful woman was expensive, and the lords could not afford to buy her. Later, King Qin spent three thousand gold to buy the beautiful woman.

古文：韩因以其金事秦，秦反得其金与韩之美人。
现代文：韩国于是用这三千金来讨好秦国，这样秦国反而收回了那三千金，又得了韩国的美人。
English: South Korea then used the three thousand gold to curry favor with Qin, so Qin took back the three thousand gold and got the Korean beauty.

古文：韩之美人因言于秦曰： 韩甚疏秦。 
现代文：韩国的美人因此对秦王抱怨说： 韩国对秦国很疏远。 
English: As a result, the Korean beauty complained to the King of Qin: Korea is very distant from Qin.

古文：从是观之，韩亡美人与金，其疏秦乃始益明。
现代文：由此可见，韩国不但失去了美女和钱财，而且使它实际上疏远秦国的态度更加明显。
English: From this, it can be seen that South Korea not only lost its beautiful women and money, but also made its attitude of actually alienating Qin more obvious.

古文：故客有说韩者曰： 不如止淫用，以是为金以事秦，是金必行，而韩之疏秦不明。
现代文：所以有人劝说韩国说： 不如停止一切奢侈生活，然后积存财富来侍奉秦国，只要有金钱必然能起作用，而韩国疏远秦国的事也不会暴露，美女是了解国家秘密的。
English: Therefore, someone persuaded South Korea to say: It is better to stop all luxury life, and then accumulate wealth to serve Qin. As long as there is money, it will certainly work, and South Korea's alienation from Qin will not be exposed. Beauty is to understand national secrets.

古文：美人知内行者也，故善为计者，不见内行。 
现代文：因此善于谋划的人，不能让国家的实际意图泄露出去。 
English: Therefore, those who are good at planning cannot let the country's actual intentions leak out.
