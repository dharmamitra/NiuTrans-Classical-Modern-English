古文：或为周最谓金投曰： 秦以周最之齐疑天下，而又知赵之难予齐人战，恐齐、韩之合，必先合于秦。
现代文：有人作为周最的说客对赵国的金投说： 秦国派周最到齐国去的目的是为了使天下诸侯疑惧秦、齐联合，并且秦国又知道赵国难以与齐国作战，恐怕齐、韩两国和好之前，必定先同秦国联合。
English: As Zhou's most important lobbyist, someone said to Zhao's financial investment: The purpose of Qin sending Zhou to Qi was to make the world's princes fear Qin and Qi's alliance, and Qin also knew that Zhao would find it difficult to fight against Qi. I'm afraid that before Qi and South Korea can be reconciled, they must first unite with Qin.

古文：秦、齐合，则公之国虚矣。
现代文：如果齐、秦两国联合起来。
English: If Qi and Qin unite, the two countries will succeed.

古文：公不如救齐，因佐秦而伐韩、魏，上党长子赵之有。
现代文：那么您的赵国就要变成废墟了。您不如救助齐国，再帮助秦国去讨伐韩国和魏国，那么上党的长子就归赵国所有了。
English: Then your state of Zhao will be in ruins. You might as well save Qi and help Qin to fight Korea and Wei. Then the eldest son of the upper party will belong to Zhao.

古文：公东收宝于秦，南取地于韩，魏因以困，徐为之东，则有合矣。 
现代文：这样，您在东边可以收到秦国送来的宝物，在南边又能夺取韩国的土地，魏国就会因此而陷入困境，再逐步地向东边扩展，那么齐国只有向赵国求和了。
English: In this way, in the east, you can receive the treasures sent by Qin, and in the south, you can seize the land of South Korea. Wei will be in trouble because of this, and then gradually expand to the east. Then, Qi can only ask for peace from Zhao.
