古文：杜赫欲重景翠于周，谓周君曰： 君之国小，尽君子重宝珠玉以事诸侯，不可不察也。
现代文：杜赫想让东周重用景翠，就对东周国君说： 您的国家很小，倾尽全国的珍宝侍奉显赫诸侯的笼络人心的方法，不是太适合，不能不慎重考虑一下。
English: Duhe wanted Dong Zhou to make heavy use of the scenery, so he said to Dong Zhou Guojun: Your country is very small, and the method of pouring out the treasures of the whole country to serve the prominent princes is not very suitable, and we must carefully consider it.

古文：譬之如张罗者，张于无鸟之所，则终日无所得矣；张于多鸟处，则又骇鸟矣；必张于有鸟无鸟之际，然后能多得鸟矣。
现代文：您的做法就像把网设在没有鸟的地方，永远也不会捕到鸟；如果把网设在鸟多的地方，就会使鸟察觉到，又会把使鸟惊飞。只有把网设在有鸟而鸟不多的地方，才会捕到很多鸟。
English: Your approach is like setting a net in a place where there are no birds, it will never catch birds; if you set a net in a place with many birds, it will make the birds aware, and it will scare the birds away. Only if you set a net in a place where there are birds but not many birds, will you catch many birds.

古文：今君将施于大人，大人轻君；施于小人，小人无可以求，又费财焉。

English: Now you spend your money on famous people who despise you; spend it on ordinary people who are worthless and a waste of money.

古文：君必施于今之穷士，不必且为大人者，故能得欲矣。 
现代文：君王只有把钱花在暂时穷困潦倒，现在并不显赫，将来一定成大器的人身上，这样才能达到您的目的。 
English: The king can only achieve his goal by spending money on people who are temporarily impoverished, who are not prominent now, and who will certainly become great in the future.
