古文：为周最谓魏王曰： 秦知赵之难与齐战也，将恐齐、赵之合也，必阴劲之。
现代文：有人替周最对魏襄王说： 秦国知道赵国害怕同齐国作战，秦国又唯恐齐、赵结盟，因此一定会在暗地里支持援助赵国。
English: Someone said to Wei Xiang Wang on behalf of Zhou: Qin knows that Zhao is afraid to fight with Qi, and Qin is afraid to ally with Qi and Zhao, so it will definitely support and aid Zhao in secret.

古文：赵不敢战，恐秦不己收也，先合于齐。
现代文：赵国不敢与齐国交战，因为担心秦国不支持自己，假意与自己结盟实际上先与齐国结盟。
English: Zhao did not dare to fight against Qi, because he was afraid that Qin would not support him, so he pretended to ally with himself, but actually allied with Qi first.

古文：秦、赵争齐，而王无人焉，不可。
现代文：这样就会出现秦、赵两国都争着讨好齐国的局面，大王杀了周最就没有人去联合齐国了，这是不行的。
English: In this way, a situation will arise in which both Qin and Zhao are competing to please Qi. If the Great King killed Zhou, there would be no one left to unite Qi. This is unacceptable.

古文：王不去周最，合与收齐，而以兵之急则伐齐，无因事也。 
现代文：现在如果大王不派遣周最去联合并争取齐国，等到秦兵紧急出兵攻打齐国的时候，这件事就很不好办了。 
English: Now, if the great king does not send Zhou to unite and fight for Qi, when the Qin soldiers urgently attack Qi, it will be very difficult to do this.
