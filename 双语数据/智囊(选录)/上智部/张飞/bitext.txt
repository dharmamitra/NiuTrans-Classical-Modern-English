古文：先主一见马超，以为平西将军，封都亭侯，超见先主待之厚也，阔略无上下礼，与先主言，常呼字，关羽怒，请杀之，先主不从，张飞曰： 如是，当示之以礼。 
现代文：刘备见到马超很高兴，并立刻任命他为平西将军，封都亭侯。马超见刘备对待自己如此优厚，便不免有些傲慢，甚至疏忽了对主上的礼节，和刘备讲话时，常常直呼刘备的字。关羽非常生气，请求杀掉马超，刘备不肯。张飞说： 像这种情形，应当用礼节来引导警示他。 
English: Liu Bei was very happy to see Ma Chao, and immediately appointed him as the general of Pingxi and the vassal of the capital. Seeing Liu Bei treat him so generously, Ma Chao could not help but be a little arrogant, and even neglected the etiquette of the Lord. When talking to Liu Bei, he often directly called Liu Bei. Guan Yu was very angry and asked to kill Ma Chao, but Liu Bei refused. Zhang Fei said: In such a situation, you should use etiquette to guide and warn him.

古文：明日大会诸将，羽、飞并挟刃立直，超入，顾坐席，不见羽、飞座，见其直也，乃大惊。
现代文：第二天，刘备会见诸将，关羽、张飞手执兵器侍立刘备两边。马超一到，径直入座，但却没看到关羽和张飞的座位，只见二将侍立一旁，不由大吃一惊，极为惶恐。
English: The next day, Liu Bei met with the generals, and Guan Yu and Zhang Fei stood on both sides of Liu Bei, holding weapons. As soon as Ma Chao arrived, he went straight to his seat, but he did not see Guan Yu and Zhang Fei's seats, only to see the two generals standing by. He was taken aback and very frightened.

古文：自后乃尊事先主。
现代文：从此以后，马超才恭敬地侍奉刘备。
English: Since then, Ma Chaocai has served Liu Bei respectfully.

古文：释严颜，诲马超，都是细心作用，后世目飞为粗人，大枉。
现代文：冯述评释放严颜，警示马超，都是细心之人才能做得到的。后世把张飞当做粗人，实在是大大冤枉了他。
English: Feng commented that the release of Yan Yan and the warning of Ma Chao can only be done by careful people. Later generations regarded Zhang Fei as a brute, which really greatly wronged him.
