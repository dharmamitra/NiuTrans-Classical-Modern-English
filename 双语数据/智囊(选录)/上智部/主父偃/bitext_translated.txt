古文：汉患诸侯强，主父偃谋令诸侯以私恩自裂地，分其子弟，而汉为定其封号；汉有厚恩而诸侯渐自分析弱小云。
现代文：原文西汉的时候汉武帝忧患各诸侯实力太过强盛，主父偃出谋令各诸侯王可以推施皇帝的恩泽，将自己的封地划开，再分给自己的子弟，只要由汉王为其确定封号就行。自此，汉室有了广厚的恩泽而各诸侯也逐渐分崩离析，实力也渐渐变得弱小了。
English: During the Western Han Dynasty, Emperor Hanwu was worried that the power of each vassal state was too strong. His father came up with a plan to allow each vassal state to push the emperor's favor, divide their fiefs, and then distribute them to their children, as long as the Han king determined the seal number for them. Since then, the Han dynasty has had a wide range of favors and the vassals have gradually fallen apart, and their power has gradually become weak.
