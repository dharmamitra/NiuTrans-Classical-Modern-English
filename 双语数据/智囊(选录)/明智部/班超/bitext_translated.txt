古文：超曰：班超 塞外吏士，本非孝子顺孙，皆以罪过徙补边屯。而蛮夷怀鸟兽之心，难养易败。今君性严急，水清无鱼，察政不得下和，宜荡佚简易，宽小过，总大纲而已。 
现代文：班超说： 塞外的官吏士卒，本来就不是守法的子民，都因为犯罪而被流放边境戊守；而蛮人心如禽兽，难养易变；你个性比较严厉急切，要知道水太清便养不了鱼，过于明察，事事计较便得不到属下的心，我建议你稍微放松一些，力求简易，有些小过失、小问题闭闭眼也就不必去追究，凡事只要把大原则掌握好久可以了。 
English: Banchao said: Foreign officials and bureaucrats are not law-abiding citizens by nature. They have all been exiled to guard the border because of crimes. But the hearts of barbarians are like animals, difficult to raise and changeable. Your personality is rather strict and eager. You should know that if the water is too clear, you cannot raise fish. If you are too clear-sighted, you will not win the hearts of your subordinates. I suggest that you relax a little and strive to be simple. If you close your eyes to some small mistakes and small problems, you do not have to pursue them. All you need to do is master the big principles for a long time.
