古文：李纲欲用张所，然所尝论宰相黄潜善，纲颇难之。
现代文：原文宋朝时李纲想推荐张所为河北宣抚司使，但是张所曾经非议过宰相黄潜善，因此感觉非常为难。
English: At the time of the Song Dynasty, Li Gang wanted to recommend Zhang So as the envoy of the Hebei Propaganda and Guidance Department, but Zhang So had once criticized the Prime Minister Huang Kuanzhen, so he felt very embarrassed.

古文：一日遇潜善，款语曰： 今当艰难之秋，负天下重责，而四方士大夫，号召未有来者。
现代文：一天，李纲恰好遇到黄潜善，就悄悄对他说： 现在国家处境艰难，身为朝廷命官，负有维护天下安危的重任，但是四方的士大夫，号召没有来的。
English: One day, Li Gang happened to meet Huang Kuanzhong, and quietly said to him: Now the country is in a difficult situation. As an official of the imperial court, he has the important task of safeguarding the world's security. However, the call of the four officials did not come.

古文：前议置河北宣抚司，独一张所可用。又以狂妄有言得罪，如所之罪，孰谓不宜？
现代文：前次朝廷提议设置河北宣抚司，唯独张所可以任用，但是张所曾经以狂妄的言辞冒犯过相国，以他所犯的罪，再委任他确实不恰当，可是迫于现在国家的情势，不得不试用他。
English: The last time the imperial court proposed to set up a Hebei Propaganda and Guidance Department, only Zhang So could be appointed. However, Zhang So had offended his country with arrogant words, and it was indeed inappropriate to reappoint him for the crime he had committed. However, due to the current situation of the country, he had to be tried.

古文：第今日势迫，不得不试用之，如用以为台谏，处要地，则不可；使之借官为招抚，冒死立功以赎过，似无嫌。 
现代文：当然，如果让他在京师担任御史台的职务或者谏官是行不通的，不如任命他为招抚使，让他冒死立功赎罪，似乎还说得过去。 
English: Of course, if it is not feasible to have him hold the post of imperial historian or eunuch in the Beijing division, it would be better to appoint him as a mediating envoy and let him risk his life to atone for his sins. It seems to be possible.

古文：潜善欣然许之。
现代文：黄潜善欣然同意了。
English: Huang Quesen readily agreed.
