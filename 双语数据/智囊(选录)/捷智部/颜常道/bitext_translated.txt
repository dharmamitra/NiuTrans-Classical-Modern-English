古文：颜常道曰： 某年河水围濮州，城窦失戒，夜发声如雷，须臾巷水没骭。
现代文：原文颜常道说： 有一年河水暴涨，濮州被水围困，由于城墙的漏洞疏于防护，夜晚河水从孔洞中涌入，夜晚发出的声音好像巨雷一般，一会儿工夫，城中巷道的积水就已经到达了膝头。
English: The original text Yan Changdao said: One year, the river water surged, Luzhou was besieged by water, due to the loopholes in the city wall and the lack of protection, the river water poured in from the holes at night, and the sound emitted at night was like thunder. In a short time, the accumulated water in the city's roadway had already reached the knees.

古文：士有献衣袽之法，其要，取绵絮胎，缚作团，大小不一，使善泅卒沿城扪漏便塞之，水势即弭，众工随兴，城堞无虞。 
现代文：有人建议，用破衣物将那些洞堵住，取来大大小小的棉团，命令善于游泳的小兵，沿着城墙用手探索墙上的孔洞，然后塞入棉团，果然不久城内的积水就退去了，随后工人们立即动工修补城墙，城池没有危险。 
English: It was suggested that the holes should be plugged with torn clothes, large and small cotton balls should be taken, and small soldiers who were good swimmers should be ordered to explore the holes in the wall with their hands along the city wall, and then stuffed into cotton balls. Sure enough, the accumulated water in the city soon receded, and then the workers immediately started to repair the city wall. There was no danger to the city.
