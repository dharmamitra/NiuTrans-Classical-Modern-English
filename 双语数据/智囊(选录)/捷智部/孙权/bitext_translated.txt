现代文：有一天，孙权乘着大船窥探曹操的军营，曹营中的弓箭手一时间万箭齐发，面向曹营的船身全插满了箭，船失去平衡开始倾斜，有翻船的危险，孙权立即下令掉转船头，用船的另外一面承受曹营的弓箭，于是船身两面受箭平衡，不再倾斜。
English: One day, Sun Quan was on a large ship spying on Cao Cao's military camp. The archers in Cao's camp fired a million arrows at once. The hull facing Cao's camp was full of arrows. The ship lost its balance and began to tilt, risking capsizing. Sun Quan immediately ordered the bow to be turned, using the other side of the ship to bear Cao's bow and arrows. As a result, the two sides of the hull were balanced by the arrows and no longer tilted.
