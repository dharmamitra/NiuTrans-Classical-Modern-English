English: Aiko said, "In that case, are all those people who wear Shang Dynasty-style ceremonial hats, shoes tied with shoelaces, and wide belts with a morning board inserted in the belt, are they all virtuous?" Confucius replied, "Not necessarily.

古文：孔子对曰： 不必然，夫端衣玄裳，絻而乘路者，志不在于食荤；斩衰菅屦，杖而啜粥者，志不在于酒肉。
现代文：那些穿着祭祀礼服、黑色礼袍、戴着礼帽而乘坐祭天大车的人，他们的心思不在于吃荤；披麻带孝、穿着茅草编成的鞋、撑着孝棍而吃薄粥的人，他们的心思不在于喝酒吃肉。
English: Those who ride in the sacrificial chariot wearing ceremonial dress, black robes, and ceremonial hats are not thinking about eating meat; those who wear hemp belts, shoes made of thatch, and sticks to eat thin gruel are not thinking about drinking alcohol or eating meat.

古文：生今之世，志古之道；居今之俗，服古之服；舍此而为非者，虽有，不亦鲜乎！ 哀公曰： 善！ 
现代文：生在当今的世上，牢记着古代的原则；处在当今的习俗中，穿着古代式样的服装；做到这样而为非作歹的人，即使有，不也很少吗？ 哀公说： 好！

古文：孔子曰： 人有五仪：有庸人，有士，有君子，有贤人，有大圣。

古文：哀公曰： 敢问何如斯可谓庸人矣？ 
现代文：哀公说： 请问什么样的人才能被称为平庸的人？ 
English: Aiko said: What kind of person can be called a mediocre person?

古文：孔子对曰： 所谓庸人者，口不道善言，心不知邑邑；不知选贤人善士托其身焉以为己忧；动行不知所务，止立不知所定；日选择于物，不知所贵；从物如流，不知所归；五凿为正，心从而坏：如此则可谓庸人矣。 哀公曰： 善！
现代文：孔子回答说： 所谓平庸的人，就是嘴里说不出好话，心里也不知道忧愁，不知道考虑选用和依靠贤人善士；出动时不知道去干什么，立定时不知道立脚点在哪里；天天在各种事物中挑选，却不知道什么东西贵重；一味顺从外界的事情就像流水似的，不知道归宿在哪里；为耳、目、鼻、口、心的欲望所主宰，思想也就跟着变坏。像这样，就可以称之为平庸的人了。 哀公说： 好！
English: Confucius replied, "A so-called mediocre person is one who cannot say a kind word with his mouth, who does not know sorrow in his heart, who does not know how to choose and rely on wise and good people, who does not know what to do when he sets out, and does not know where to stand when he settles down, who chooses from all kinds of things every day, but does not know what is precious, who simply follows the things of the outside world like flowing water, and does not know where to return, and whose thoughts are dominated by the desires of the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and heart, and thus his thoughts deteriorate. In this way, he can

古文：敢问何如斯可谓士矣？ 
现代文：请问像怎样可以称之为士人？

古文：孔子对曰： 所谓士者，虽不能尽道术，必有率也；虽不能遍美善，必有处也。
现代文：孔子回答说： 所谓士人，即使不能彻底掌握治国的原则和方法，但必定有所遵循；即使不能尽善尽美，但必定有所操守。
English: Confucius replied: The so-called scholars, even if they cannot completely grasp the principles and methods of governing the country, must follow them; even if they cannot be perfect, they must have ethics.

古文：是故知不务多，务审其所知；言不务多，务审其所谓；行不务多，务审其所由。
现代文：所以他了解知识不求多，而务求审慎地对待自己的知识；说话不求多，而务求审慎地对待自己所说的话；做事不求多，而务求审慎地对待自己所经手的事。
English: Therefore, he understands that he should not seek more knowledge, but should be prudent with his knowledge; he should not seek more speech, but should be prudent with what he says; he should not seek more work, but should be prudent with what he does.

古文：故知既已知之矣，言既已谓之矣，行既已由之矣，则若性命肌肤之不可易也。
现代文：知识已经了解了，话已经说了，事已经做了，那就像自己的生命和肌肤一样不可能再加以改变了。
English: Knowledge has been understood, words have been spoken, things have been done that are as impossible to change as one's own life and skin.

古文：故富贵不足以益也，卑贱不足以损也：如此则可谓士矣。 哀公曰： 善！
现代文：所以富贵并不能使他增加些什么，卑贱并不能使他减少些什么。像这样，就可以称之为士人了。 哀公说： 好！
English: Therefore, being rich does not add anything to him, and being lowly does not reduce him. In this way, he can be called a scholar. Aiko said, "Good!

古文：敢问何如斯可谓之君子矣？ 
现代文：请问像怎样才可以称之为君子？ 
English: Excuse me, but how can one be called a gentleman?

古文：孔子对曰： 所谓君子者，言忠信而心不德，仁义在身而色不伐，思虑明通而辞不争，故犹然如将可及者，君子也。 哀公曰： 善！
现代文：孔子回答说： 所谓君子，就是说话忠诚守信而心里并不自认为有美德，仁义之道充满在身而脸上并不露出炫耀的神色，思考问题明白通达而说话却不与人争辩。所以洒脱舒缓好像快要被人赶上似的，就是君子了。 哀公说： 好！
English: Confucius replied, "A gentleman is one who speaks truthfully and faithfully, but does not think of virtue in his heart; one who is filled with the way of benevolence and righteousness, but does not flaunt it in his face; one who thinks things through clearly, but does not argue with others; one who is easy-going and relaxed, as if he is about to be overtaken by others, is a gentleman."

古文：敢问何如斯可谓贤人矣？ 
现代文：请问像怎样才可以称之为贤人？ 
English: Excuse me, but how can one be called a sage?

古文：孔子对曰： 所谓贤人者，行中规绳而不伤于本，言足法于天下而不伤于身，富有天下而无怨财，布施天下而不病贫：如此则可谓贤人矣。 
现代文：孔子回答说： 所谓贤人，就是行为符合规矩法度而不伤害本身，言论能够被天下人取法而不伤害自己，富裕得拥有天下而没有私藏的财富，把财物施舍给天下人而不用担忧自己会贫穷。像这样，就可以称之为贤人了。 
English: Confucius replied, "The so-called wise man is one whose behavior conforms to the rules and regulations without harming himself, whose speech can be used by the people of the world without harming himself, who is rich enough to own the world without having hidden wealth, and who gives away his wealth to the people of the world without worrying about becoming poor. In this way, one can be called a wise man.

古文：哀公曰： 善！
现代文：哀公说： 好！
English: Aiko said: Good!

古文：敢问何如斯可谓大圣矣？ 
现代文：请问像怎样才可以称之为伟大的圣人？ 
English: How can one be called a great saint?

古文：孔子对曰： 所谓大圣者，知通乎大道，应变而不穷，辨乎万物之情性者也。
现代文：孔子回答说： 所谓伟大的圣人，就是智慧能通晓大道，面对各种事变而不会穷于应付，能明辨万物性质的人。
English: Confucius replied: The so-called great sage is a person whose wisdom can understand the road, face all kinds of events without being overwhelmed, and can discern the nature of all things.

古文：大道者，所以变化遂成万物也；情性者，所以理然不取舍也。
现代文：大道，是变化形成万物的根源；万物的性质，是处理是非、取舍的根据。
English: The Great Way is the source of change that forms all things; the nature of all things is the basis for dealing with right and wrong and making trade-offs.

古文：是故其事大辨乎天地，明察乎日月，总要万物于风雨，缪缪肫肫，其事不可循，若天之嗣，其事不可识，百姓浅然不识其邻：若此则可谓大圣矣。 哀公曰： 善！ 
现代文：所以，圣人做的事情像天地一样广大普遍，像日月一样明白清楚，像风雨一样统辖万物，温温和和诚恳不倦。他做的事情不可能被沿袭，好像是上天主管的一样；他做的事情不可能被认识，老百姓浅陋地甚至不能认识和它相近的事情。像这样，就可以称之为伟大的圣人了。 哀公说： 好！ 
English: Therefore, what the sage does is as vast and universal as heaven and earth, as clear as the sun and moon, and governs all things like the wind and rain, and is gentle and sincere without tiring. What he does cannot be followed, as if it were governed by heaven; what he does cannot be known, and the common people cannot even know things that are close to it. In this way, it can be called a great sage. Aiko said: Good!

English: Confucius said: When you enter the gate of the ancestral temple, turn to the right, climb the steps from the east, look up to see the rafters of the rafters, and look down to see the spiritual position.

English: Now, Higashino has finished driving the car, climbed on the driver's hand to hold the reins, and the horse's jawbone and body have been straightened; the slow walk and fast run to drive the Mercedes have all reached the etiquette prescribed by the court; after experiencing various obstacles and reaching the distance, the horse's strength has run out.
