古文：三年之丧何也？
现代文：守丧三年是根据什么来制定的呢？
English: What is the basis for the three-year mourning period?

古文：曰：称情而立文，因以饰群，别亲疏贵践之节，而不可损益也。
现代文：回答是：是根据与哀情相称而制定的礼文，藉此来表明亲属关系，区别亲疏贵贱的界限，因而是不能任意增减的。
English: The answer is: it is based on a ritual that is proportionate to the sorrow, and is used to show kinship, to distinguish the boundaries of kinship and kinship, and therefore cannot be arbitrarily increased or decreased.

古文：故曰：无易之道也。
现代文：所以说这是不能更改的原则。
English: So this is a principle that cannot be changed.

古文：创巨者其日久，痛甚者其愈迟，三年者，称情而立文，所以为至痛极也。
现代文：创伤巨大，复原的日子就长；悲痛愈深，平复的时间就慢。守丧三年的规定，就是根据内心哀痛程度而制定的与之相称的礼文，用来表示无以复加的悲痛。
English: The trauma is huge, the recovery time is long; the deeper the grief, the slower the recovery time. The three-year mourning period is a corresponding ritual, which is based on the degree of inner grief, and is used to express immeasurable grief.

古文：斩衰苴杖，居倚庐，食粥，寝苫枕块，所以为至痛饰也。
现代文：守丧三年，身穿斩衰，手持直杖，住在倚庐，进食稀粥，睡在草苫上，用土块当枕头，凡此种种，都是用来表明内心的巨大哀痛。
English: Three years of mourning, wearing sackcloth, holding a cane, living in a lean-to, eating gruel, sleeping on straw, using clods of earth as pillows, all of these are used to show the great sorrow in the heart.

古文：三年之丧，二十五月而毕；哀痛未尽，思慕未忘，然而服以是断之者，岂不送死者有已，复生有节哉？
现代文：三年的守丧期限，其实二十五个月就结束了。虽然心中哀痛还没有平息，对父母的思念仍然存在，但丧服要在这个时候除掉，这难道不是守丧有终止的期限，恢复正常的生活也有界限吗？
English: The three-year mourning period is actually over in twenty-five months. Although the grief in my heart has not subsided, and the thought of my parents still exists, the mourning clothes should be removed at this time. Isn't it a time limit for mourning, and a limit for returning to normal life?

古文：凡生天地之间者，有血气之属必有知，有知之属莫不知爱其类；今是大鸟兽，则失丧其群匹，越月逾时焉，则必反巡，过其故乡，翔回焉，鸣号焉，蹢躅焉，踟蹰焉，然后乃能去之；小者至于燕雀，犹有啁之顷焉，然后乃能去之；故有血气之属者，莫知于人，故人于其亲也，至死不穷。
现代文：天地之间的一切生物，只要是有血有肉有气息的动物，就一定有知觉。
English: All creatures between heaven and earth, as long as they are animals with flesh and blood and breath, must have consciousness.

古文：将由夫患邪淫之人与，则彼朝死而夕忘之，然而从之，则是曾鸟兽之不若也，夫焉能相与群居而不乱乎？
现代文：凡是有知觉的动物，没有不知道爱护自己同类的。就说大的鸟兽吧，如果丧失了自己的同伴，即使过了一个月或一个季节，还要拐回来巡视；经过过去居住的巢穴时，必定要盘旋号叫，或者徘徊良久，然后才依依不舍地离开。
English: There is no sentient animal that does not know how to cherish its own kind, let alone a large bird or beast. If it loses its companion, even if it has been a month or a season, it will return to patrol; when passing through the nest where it used to live, it must circle and call, or linger for a long time, and then reluctantly leave.

古文：将由夫修饰之君子与，则三年之丧，二十五月而毕，若驷之过隙，然而遂之，则是无穷也。
现代文：哪怕是燕子、麻雀一类的小鸟，在这种情况下，也要叽叽喳喳地哀鸣一阵，然后才依依不舍地离开。
English: Even small birds such as swallows and sparrows, under such circumstances, have to chirp and wail for a while before they reluctantly leave.

古文：故先王焉为之立中制节，壹使足以成文理，则释之矣。然则何以至期也？曰：至亲以期断。
现代文：那么丧期为一年的丧服是根据什么制定的呢？回答是：为某些至亲而不至尊的亲属服丧满一年就应除服。
English: So what is the basis for the one-year mourning period? The answer is that the mourning clothes should be removed after one year of mourning for some relatives who are not the most important.

古文：是何也？
现代文：这是什么道理呢？
English: Why is that?

古文：曰：天地则已易矣，四时则已变矣，其在天地之中者，莫不更始焉，以是象之也。
现代文：回答是：一年之中，天地已经运行了一周，四季已经循环了一遍，天地之间，万象无不更新，所以制定出一年的丧服来效法它。
English: The answer is: in a year, heaven and earth have been running for a week, the four seasons have been cycled again, between heaven and earth, all things must be updated, so we have developed a year of mourning clothes to imitate it.

古文：然则何以三年也？
现代文： 那为什么有的丧服要到第三年才期满呢？ 
English: So why do some funeral clothes not expire until the third year?

古文：曰：加隆焉尔也，焉使倍之，故再期也。
现代文：回答是： 是因为死者地位尊贵而特加隆重，于是使丧期延长到双倍时间，所以要服满两年。 
English: The answer is: It is because the deceased's status was so high and so grand that the mourning period was extended to double the time, so he had to serve the full two years.

古文：由九月以下何也？
现代文： 那么丧期是九月以下的又是何道理呢？ 
English: So what is the reason for the mourning period being September or later?

古文：曰：焉使弗及也。故三年以为隆，缌小功以为杀，期九月以为间。
现代文：答道： 因为有的亲属赶不上至亲那么亲，于是丧期也就比不上至亲。 所以五服之中，三年的丧期是最隆重的，绝麻三月和小功五月是最轻的丧服，齐衰一周年和大功九月是二者之间的丧服。
English: Answer: Because some relatives are not as close as the next-of-kin, so the period of mourning is not as long as the next-of-kin. Therefore, among the five funerals, the three-year period of mourning is the most solemn, the March of the Year of the Horse and the May of the Minor Merit are the lightest funerals, and the first anniversary of the decline of Qi and the September of the Major Merit are the funerals between the two.

古文：上取象于天，下取法于地，中取则于人，人之所以群居和壹之理尽矣。
现代文：这种规定，上则取法于天，下则取法于地，中间则取法于人情，人们之所以能够集体生活而又和谐一致的道理都表现出来了。
English: The reason why people can live collectively and harmoniously is demonstrated by the fact that this kind of regulation takes the law from heaven at the top, the law from the earth at the bottom, and the law from human feelings in the middle.

古文：故三年之丧，人道之至文者也，夫是之谓至隆。是百王之所同，古今之所壹也，未有知其所由来者也。
现代文：所以守丧三年是人情中最完美的体现。这种最隆重的礼仪，是历代天子所共同遵循的，是古往今来无人违背的，也不知道究竟已经实行了多么长的时间了。
English: Therefore, the three-year mourning period is the most perfect expression of human feelings. This grandest of ceremonies has been followed by the sons of heaven throughout the ages, has never been violated, and it is not known how long it has been practiced.

古文：孔子曰： 生三年，然后免于父母之怀；夫三年之丧，天下之达丧也。 
现代文：孔子说： 孩子生下三年以后才能离开父母的怀抱，所以，父母去世，孩子为之服丧三年，这也是普天之下通行的丧礼。 
English: Confucius said: It takes three years for a child to leave the arms of its parents. Therefore, when a parent dies, the child mourns for three years. This is also a universal funeral.
