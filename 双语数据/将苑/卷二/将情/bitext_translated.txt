古文：夫为将之道，军井未汲，将不言渴；军食未熟，将不言饥；军火未然，将不言寒；军幕未施，将不言困。夏不操扇，雨不张盖，与众同也。
现代文：身为将帅，在作风上还要注意一些日常的小事：军营中的水井还没有打上水来时，作将帅的就不要先喊口渴；给士卒吃的饭没有煮好，将帅也不要先喊饥饿；军营中的火堆还没有点燃，将帅也不能先叫寒冷；军中的帐篷还没有搭造完毕，将帅也不能先言困乏；夏天酷热，将帅不要轻易地拿把扇子取凉；多雨天气，将帅也不要首先举伞避雨，总之，在各种生活细节上要处处与士兵相同。
English: As a general officer, you should also pay attention to some daily trifles in your work style: when the well in the camp has not been filled with water, the general officer should not shout thirst first; the meal for the soldiers has not been cooked well, and the general officer should not shout hunger first; the fire in the camp has not been lit, and the general officer can not call cold first; the tents in the army have not been completed, and the general officer can not say tired first; the summer is very hot, the general officer should not easily take a fan to cool down; rainy weather, the general officer should not first raise an umbrella to avoid the rain, in short, in all aspects of life
