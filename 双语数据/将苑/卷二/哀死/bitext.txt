古文：古之善将者，养人如养己子，有难则以身先之，有功则以身后之；伤者，泣而抚之；死者，哀而葬之；饥者，舍食而食之；寒者，解衣而衣之；智者，礼而禄之；勇者，赏而劝之。
现代文：古代凡是优秀的将领，对待自己的部下就好象对待自己的儿女一样，当困难来临时，身先士卒，首当其冲，站在最前面，在功劳荣誉面前，与部下谦让，把功劳、荣誉推给部下，对待受伤的士卒，百般安慰和抚恤，当部下为国捐躯时，又能厚葬他们，并妥善地安排好后事，在粮食不够吃时，主动地把自己的食物让给下级，在天气寒冷的时候，把自己的衣服让给士卒穿用，对待有才智的人，以礼相待，并委之以高官，对待英勇擅战的部下，他会给予恰当、及时的奖赏并勉励他再立新功。
English: In ancient times, all outstanding generals treated their subordinates as if they were their own children. When difficulties came, they were the first to bear the brunt, standing at the forefront. In the face of merit and honor, they were humble with their subordinates, pushing the merit and honor to their subordinates. They treated injured soldiers with various consolations and palliatives. When their subordinates died for the country, they were able to bury them and properly arrange the aftermath. When there was not enough food to eat, they voluntarily gave their food to the lower ranks. When the weather was cold, they gave their clothes to the soldiers to wear. They treated talented people with courtesy, and entrusted high-ranking officials
