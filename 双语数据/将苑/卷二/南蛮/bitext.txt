古文：南蛮多种，性不能教，连合朋党，失意则相攻。居洞依山，或聚或散，西至昆仑，东至洋海，海产奇货，故人贪而勇战。春夏多疾疫，利在疾战，不可久师也。
现代文：南部有许多小的野蛮民族，他们的性情是无法教化的，这些民族常常结合成不同的利益团体，遇到大的利害就互相攻伐，他们平时住在山洞水边，有的民族聚集一处，有的民族则分散在各处，西到昆仑山、东到大海都是他们活动的范围，他们那里海产奇货，敌人个个贪婪好战，春夏两季常发生瘟疫，所以对南蛮用兵，只能速战速决，不可以久留。
English: In the south, there are many small barbarian nations. Their disposition is uneducable. These nations often combine into different interest groups and attack each other when they encounter great interests. They usually live in caves by the water's edge. Some nations gather in one place, while others are scattered everywhere. West to Kunlun Mountain and east to the sea are the scope of their activities. They have exotic seafood, each enemy is greedy and warlike, and plagues often occur in the spring and summer. Therefore, soldiers can only be used against the barbarians in the south, and they can only be used quickly. They cannot stay for a long time.
