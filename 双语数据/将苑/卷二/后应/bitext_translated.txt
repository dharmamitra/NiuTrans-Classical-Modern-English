古文：若乃图难于易，为大于细，先动后用，刑于无刑，此用兵之智也。
现代文：如果能把危险的局面转换成容易的事情，在事情还没有转变成复杂之前就预先做了准备，在事情还没有变得不可收拾时就采取了应对措施，在军中设立了严明的刑罚但不以动用刑为最终目的，这是用兵的上策，这样的首领是智者。
English: If a dangerous situation can be transformed into an easy one, if preparations are made in advance before things become complicated, if countermeasures are taken before things become unmanageable, and if strict punishments are established in the army, but the ultimate goal is not to use punishment, this is the best strategy for using soldiers. Such a leader is a wise man.

古文：师徒已列，戎马交驰，强弩才临，短兵又接，乘威布信，敌人告急，此用兵之能也。

古文：身冲矢石，争胜一时，成败未分，我伤彼死，此用兵之下也。
