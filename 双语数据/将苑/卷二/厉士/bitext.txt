古文：夫用兵之道，尊之以爵，赡之以财，则士无不至矣；接之以礼，厉之以信，则士无不死矣；畜恩不倦，法若画一，则士无不服矣；先之以身，后之以人，则士无不勇矣；小善必录，小功必赏，则士无不劝矣。
现代文：将帅对待自己的部下，要委之以高位，封赏以钱财，这样就可以吸引有才德的人前来尽力；要以礼相待，以信、诚来鼓励部下，这样部下就会以舍生忘死的决心投入战斗；要经常对部下施恩惠，赏罚时公平严明，一视同仁，这样就会赢得部下的信服、敬佩；要在作战中身先士卒，冲锋陷阵，在撤退时主动掩护他人，这样部下会英勇善战；对待部下的点滴小心都要给与充分的重视，并进行适当的奖励，这样部下会积极向上，互相劝勉，永保昂扬的斗志。
