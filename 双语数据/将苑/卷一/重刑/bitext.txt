古文：吴起曰：鼓鼙金铎，所以威耳；旌帜，所以威目；禁令刑罚，所以威心。
现代文：吴起说： 军队中敲击鼙鼓、金锋的目的，在于引起士卒在听觉方面的敏锐注意力，听从指挥，挥舞旗帜，在于集中士卒在视觉方面的注意力，而各项法规、禁令及刑罚的目的在于管理士卒，节制士卒的行动。 
English: Wu Qi said: The purpose of beating the gongs and drums in the army is to arouse the keen attention of the soldiers in the auditory aspect, listen to the command, wave the flag, and concentrate the attention of the soldiers in the visual aspect, while the purpose of various regulations, prohibitions and penalties is to manage the soldiers and restrain the actions of the soldiers.

古文：耳威以声，不可不清；目威以容，不可不明；心威以刑，不可不严。
现代文：在军队中，用声音引起士卒的注意，要求士卒听从指挥时，发声的器具必须音质清脆宏亮；用旗帜来指挥士兵作战时，旗帜的颜色要鲜明、醒目；用刑罚、禁令来约束士卒的行动时，执法必须公正、严明。
English: In the army, when using sound to attract the attention of soldiers and require soldiers to obey orders, the sound equipment must be crisp and clear; when using a flag to command soldiers to fight, the color of the flag should be bright and eye-catching; when using penalties and prohibitions to restrict the actions of soldiers, law enforcement must be fair and strict.

古文：三者不立，士可怠也。
现代文：如果做不到上述三点，军容就会紊乱，士卒就会涣散、懈怠。
English: If the above three points are not achieved, the military situation will be disorderly, and the soldiers will be lazy and slack.

古文：故曰：将之所麾，莫不心移；将之所指，莫不前死矣。
现代文：所以说，在指挥部队的问题上，应该达到这样的程度：只要将帅的指挥旗帜挥舞摇动，部下就会英勇前进，只要将帅的命令一下，所有的士卒就会同仇敌忾，拼死上前，报效国家。
English: Therefore, in the issue of commanding troops, it should reach such a level: as long as the commanding officer's command banner is waved and shaken, his subordinates will advance heroically, as long as the commanding officer gives an order, all the soldiers will fight with the enemy, fight to the death, and serve the country.
