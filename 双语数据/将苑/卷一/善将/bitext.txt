古文：古之善将者有四：示之以进退，故人知禁；诱之以仁义，故人知礼；重之以是非，故人知劝；决之以赏罚，故人知信。禁、礼、劝、信，师之大经也。未有纲直而目不舒也，故能战必胜，攻必取。
现代文：从古至今，善于领兵打仗的将领用兵的原则有四点：令出如山，向部下讲明什么是进，什么叫退，什么是不应该做的；用仁、义的思想教育部下，使士卒能知书达礼；告诫部下明辨是非，使士卒能互相勉励，规过劝善；严格赏罚，使士卒不敢涣散，有信用，上述四点基本的原则：禁、礼、劝、信是部队中的重要规范，如果彻底做到了这四点，就好象主要的支架已经搭好，其它的细微末节也就自然地顺展开来，有了法规，具体的内容也就明晰了，这样军队就能战必胜，攻伐时得其所需。
English: From ancient times to the present, the principles of generals who are good at leading soldiers to fight have four points: issuing orders like a mountain, clarifying to subordinates what is to advance, what is to retreat, and what should not be done; using the ideas of benevolence and righteousness to educate subordinates, so that soldiers can know the rules and etiquette; admonishing subordinates to distinguish right from wrong, so that soldiers can encourage each other, and prevent and dissuade evil; strictly rewarding and punishing, so that soldiers do not dare to dissipate, and have credibility. The above four basic principles: prohibition, etiquette, persuasion, and trust are important norms

古文：庸将不然，退则不能止，进则不能禁，故与军同亡。无劝戒则赏罚失度，人不知信，而贤良退伏，谄顽登用，是以战必败散也。
现代文：无能的将领做不到这四点：没有规制，一旦下令撤退，士卒不听指挥，抱头鼠窜；而下令进攻时，则没有节制，步调不一，甚至纷纷逃避，怠慢拖延，全军也就难逃灭亡的下场；劝戒不明，赏罚无度，失信于士卒，上下不能一心，贤德之人纷纷远走，谄媚狡猾的小人得势，这样的将领带出的部队，一定会每战必败。
English: An incompetent general cannot accomplish the following four points: without regulation, once ordered to retreat, the soldiers do not listen to the command and hold their heads in their hands; when ordered to attack, there is no restraint, the pace is not the same, and even they escape one after another, they neglect to delay, and the whole army cannot escape the fate of death; the exhortation is unknown, the reward and punishment are boundless, the soldiers are untrustworthy, the upper and lower ranks cannot be of one mind, the virtuous people go away one after another, and the charming and cunning people gain power. The troops brought out by such a general will surely be defeated in every battle.
