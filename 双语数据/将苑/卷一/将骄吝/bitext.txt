古文：将不可骄，骄则失礼，失礼则人离，人离则众判。
现代文：做将帅的切勿骄傲自大，如果骄傲自大，待人接物就会有不周道的地方，有失礼之处，一朝失礼就会众叛亲离，人心愤懑相怨。
English: Don't be arrogant as a general. If you are arrogant, there will be a place where you don't treat people well, there will be a place where you are impolite. Once you are impolite, people will turn away from you, and people will be angry and resentful.

古文：将不可吝，吝则赏不行，赏不行则士不致命，士不致命则军无功，无功则国虚，国虚则寇实矣。
现代文：身为将领，也不能小气吝啬，如果吝惜吝啬必然不愿奖赏部下，奖赏不行，部下必定不肯在战斗中尽最大努力以拼死作战，这样下去，则在战争中不会取得什么好的成果，国家的实力也就会因此虚弱下去，自己国家实力下降就是表示敌人正在强大起来。
English: As a general, you can't be stingy and miserly. If you are stingy and miserly, you will inevitably be unwilling to reward your subordinates. Rewards are no good. Your subordinates will certainly not be willing to do their best in the battle to fight to the death. If this continues, you will not achieve any good results in the war. The strength of the country will also weaken as a result. The decline in the strength of one's own country means that the enemy is becoming stronger.

古文：孔子曰： 如有周公之才之美，使骄且吝，其余不足观也已。 
现代文：因此孔子说： 一个人尽管具备象周公那样的德才，但是却骄傲吝啬，那么即使他能做出一定的贡献，也不值得人们去评价称道 。
English: Therefore, Confucius said: Although a person has the same virtue as Zhou Gong, but he is proud and stingy, then even if he can make a certain contribution, he is not worthy of people's praise.
