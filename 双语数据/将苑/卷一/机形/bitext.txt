古文：夫以愚克智，逆也；以智克愚，顺也；以智克智，机也。
现代文：大凡愚笨的人能够战胜聪明的人，是违反常理的偶然事件；聪明的人能够战胜愚笨的人，是合乎常理的必然事情；而聪明的人在一起交战，就全看掌握战机如何了。
English: That a very stupid man should be able to defeat a clever man is an unreasonable accident; that a clever man should be able to defeat a stupid man is a reasonable necessity; and that clever men should fight together depends entirely on how well they can fly a plane.

古文：其道有三：一曰事，二曰势，三曰情。事机作而不能应，非智也；势机动而不能制，非贤也；情机发而不能行，非勇也。
现代文：掌握战机的关键有三点：一是事机，二是势机，三是情机，当事情已经发生，有利于己而不利于敌时，不能作出相应的反应，不能算是聪明；当形势发生变化，有利于己而不利于敌时，去不能拿出克敌制胜的办法，也不够贤者的资格；当整个态势已经很明确对己方有利时，却不能断然采取行动，这也不能算是勇敢。
English: The key to mastering the fighter plane is three points: one is the opportunity, the second is the potential opportunity, and the third is the emotional opportunity. When things have already happened that are beneficial to oneself and disadvantageous to the enemy, it is not possible to make a corresponding reaction, and it cannot be regarded as clever; when the situation changes, it is beneficial to oneself and disadvantageous to the enemy, it is not possible to come up with a way to restrain the enemy and win, and it is not enough to be a wise person; when the whole situation has been clearly beneficial to oneself, but it cannot be categorically acted upon, it cannot be regarded as brave.

古文：善将者，必因机而立胜。
现代文：所以，善于指挥军队的将领，一定要根据情况的变化，掌握时机取得胜利，即因机立胜。
English: Therefore, a general who is good at commanding the army must grasp the opportunity to win according to the changes in the situation, that is, to win because of the opportunity.
