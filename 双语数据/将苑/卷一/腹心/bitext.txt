古文：夫为将者，必有腹心、耳目、爪牙。
现代文：身为将领，应该有自己的左右亲信可以咨商事情，有给自己侦察消息通风报信的耳目，有坚决贯彻自己的命令辅佐自己的羽翼。
English: As a general, he should have his own right and left cronies to consult with, have his own ears and eyes to detect and report information, and resolutely carry out his own orders to assist his wings.

古文：无腹心者，如人夜行，无所措手足；无耳目者，如冥然而居，不知运动；无爪牙者，如饥人食毒物，无不死矣。
现代文：没有心腹之人，就好比人在黑夜中走路，手脚不知该迈向何处，没有耳目之人，就好比盲人安静地生活在黑暗中，不能做自己想做的事，更不能为达到某种个人目的进行钻营活动；没有爪牙之人，就好似一个人饥不择食，吃了有毒的食物，中毒身亡。
English: A person without a confidant is like a person walking in the dark, with hands and feet not knowing where to go. A person without eyes and ears is like a blind person living quietly in the dark, unable to do what he wants to do, much less carry out drilling activities to achieve a certain personal goal. A person without minions is like a person who is starving, eats poisoned food, and is poisoned to death.

古文：故善将者，必有博闻多智者为腹心，沉审谨密者为耳目，勇悍善敌者为爪牙。
现代文：所以，明智的将帅，一定要选用学识渊博、足智多谋的人做自己的心腹，要选用机智聪明、谨慎保密、有很强的判断力的人做自己的耳目，还要选择勇敢、彪悍的士兵做自己的爪牙。
English: Therefore, a wise general must choose a learned and resourceful person to be his confidant, a witty and clever person, a cautious and confidential person, and a person with strong judgment to be his eyes and ears, and a brave and tough soldier to be his minion.
