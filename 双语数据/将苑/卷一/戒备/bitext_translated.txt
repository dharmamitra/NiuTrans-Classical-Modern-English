古文：夫国之大务，莫先于戒备。若夫失之毫厘，则差若千里，覆军杀将，势不逾息，可不惧哉！
现代文：国家最重要的事务是国防，在国防的问题上稍有偏差，就会导致国家的灭亡，使全国覆没，无可挽回，这是最可怕的事情啊！
English: The most important business of the country is national defense. If there is a slight deviation in the issue of national defense, it will lead to the demise of the country, make the whole country submerged and irreparable. This is the most terrible thing!

古文：故有患难，君臣旰食而谋之，择贤而任之。
现代文：所以，一旦国家出现了危难，君臣应齐心一致，废寝忘食，共同谋策，挑选有本领的人担任将帅，指挥三军应敌。
English: Therefore, once the country is in danger, the monarchs and ministers should be of one mind, sleep and forget about food, work together to devise strategies, select capable people to serve as generals, and command the three armies to meet the enemy.

古文：若乃居安而不思危，寇至不知惧，此谓燕巢于幕，鱼游于鼎，亡不俟夕矣。传曰： 不备不虞，不可以师。 
现代文：如果不能居安思危，就是敌人已打到了家里也不能警觉，如同燕子的窝巢搭筑在门帘上，鱼儿游戏在旱锅里，灭亡的日子已经不远了。《左传》说：对事物没有计划，不准备到毫无差错的地步，不能出兵！ 
English: If you can't stay calm in the face of danger, you won't be able to stay alert even if the enemy has already hit your home, just like a swallow's nest is built on the door curtain and a fish's game is in a dry pot, the day of your demise is not far away. "Zo Zhuan" said: If you don't have a plan for things, if you don't prepare to the point of no mistakes, you can't send troops!

古文：又曰： 预备无虞，古之善政。 又曰： 蜂虿尚有毒，而况国乎？

English: In ancient times, it was considered good governance to live in a safe place, make proper arrangements, and prevent possible disasters. Small insects such as bees and scorpions use stings as a defense tool, let alone a huge country?

古文：无备，虽众不可恃也。故曰：有备无患。
现代文：如果一个国家忽视了国防建设，即使有百万之众也不可怕，所以说有备无患，就是这个意思。
English: If a country neglects the construction of national defense, even if there are millions of people, it is not terrible, so it means that there is no danger.
