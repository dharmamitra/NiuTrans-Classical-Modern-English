古文：夫兵权者，是三军之司命，主将之威势。
现代文：所谓兵权，就是将帅统率三军的权力，它是将帅建立自己的威信的关键。
English: The so-called military power is the power to command the three armies. It is the key to establishing the authority of the general.

古文：将能执兵之权，操兵之势而临群下，譬如猛虎，加之羽翼而翱翔四海，随所遇而施之。
现代文：将帅掌握了兵权，就抓住了统领军队的要点，好象一只猛虎，插上了双翼一般，不仅有威势而且能翱翔四海，遇到任何情况都能灵活应变，占据主动。
English: When the commander-in-chief grasped the military power, he grasped the key points of leading the army. Like a fierce tiger, he put his wings on, not only powerful but also able to fly around the world, and able to flexibly adapt to any situation and take the initiative.

古文：若将失权，不操其势，亦如鱼龙脱于江湖，欲求游洋之势，奔涛戏浪，何可得也。
现代文：反之，将帅如果失去了这个权力，不能指挥军队，就好象鱼、龙离开了江湖，想要求得在海洋中遨游的自由，在浪涛中奔驰嬉戏，也是不可能的。
English: On the other hand, if the commander-in-chief loses this power and cannot command the army, it is as if the fish and the dragon left the river and lake, and it is impossible to demand the freedom to swim in the ocean and play in the waves.
