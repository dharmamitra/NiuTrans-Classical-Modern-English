古文：夫军国之弊，有五害焉：一曰结党相连，毁谮贤良；二曰侈其衣服，异其冠带；三曰虚夸妖术，诡言神道；四曰专察是非，私以动众；五曰伺候得失，阴结敌人。
现代文：不论是治军还是理国，有五种人需要对之注意，他们是国家、军队混乱的祸患。这五种人是：私结朋党，搞小团体，专爱讥毁、打击有才德的人；在衣服上奢侈、浪费、穿戴与众不同的帽子、服饰、虚荣心重、哗众取宠的人；不切实际地夸大盅感民众人，制造谣言欺诈视听的人；专门搬弄是非，为了自己的私利而兴师动众的人；非常在意自己的个人得失，暗中与敌人勾结在一起的人。
English: There are five kinds of people who need to be paid attention to, regardless of whether they are in charge of the army or the country, and they are the scourge of the country and the army. These five kinds of people are: those who join cronies and form small groups, and love to ridicule and attack talented people; those who are extravagant in clothes, wasteful, wear distinctive hats and clothes, vain, and seek the favor of the public; those who exaggerate the sentiments of the people in an unrealistic manner, and create rumors to deceive the public; those who are dedicated to stirring up the masses for their own benefit; those who are very concerned about their personal gains and losses

古文：此所谓奸伪悖德之人，可远而不可亲也。
现代文：这五种虚伪奸诈、德行败坏的小人，对他们只能远离而不可亲近。
English: These five types of hypocritical, treacherous, and morally corrupt villains should be kept away from and not approached.
