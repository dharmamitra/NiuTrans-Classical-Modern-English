古文：夫知人之性，莫难察焉。
现代文：世界上没有比真正地了解一个人的本性还要困难的事情。
English: There is nothing more difficult in the world than to truly understand a person's nature.

古文：美恶既殊，情貌不一，有温良而为诈者，有外恭而内欺者，有外勇而内怯者，有尽力而不忠者。
现代文：每个人的善、恶程度不同，本性与外表也是不统一的。有的人外貌温良却行为奸诈，有的人情态恭谦却心怀欺骗，有的人看上去很勇敢而实际上却很怯懦，有的人似乎已竭尽全力但实际上却另有图谋。
English: Everyone is good or evil to a different degree, and nature and appearance are not uniform. Some people look gentle but act treacherously, some people are humble but deceitful, some people look very brave but are actually very cowardly, and some people seem to have done their best but actually have other plans.

古文：然知人之道有七焉：一曰问之以是非而观其志，二曰穷之以辞辩而观其变，三曰咨之以计谋而观其识，四曰告之以祸难而观其勇，五曰醉之以酒而观其性，六曰临之以利而观其廉，七曰期之以事而观其信。
现代文：然而，了解一个人的本性还是有七条办法的：用离间的办法询问他对某事的看法，以考察他的志向、立场；用激烈的言辞故意激怒他，以考察他的气度、应变的能力；就某个计划向他咨询，征求他的意见，以考察他的学识；告诉他大祸临头，以考察他的胆识、勇气；利用喝酒的机会，使他大醉，以观察他的本性、修养；用利益对他进行引诱，以考察他是否清廉；把某件事情交付给他去办，以考察他是否有信用，值得信任。
English: However, there are still seven ways to understand a person's nature: ask him for his opinion on something in an indirect way to examine his aspirations and position; deliberately provoke him with fierce words to examine his temperament and ability to adapt; consult him on a plan, solicit his opinion to examine his knowledge; tell him that a catastrophe is imminent to examine his courage and courage; use the opportunity of drinking to make him drunk to observe his nature and cultivation; lure him with benefits to examine whether he is clean; entrust him with a certain matter to investigate whether he is trustworthy and worthy of trust.
