古文：才觉己有不是，便决意改图，此立志为君子也；明知人议其非，偏肆行无忌，此甘心为小人也。
现代文：刚刚察觉自己有什么地方做得不对，便毫不犹豫地改正，这就是立志成为一个正人君子的做法。明明知道有人在议论自己的缺点，仍然不反省改过，反而肆无忌惮地为所欲为，这便是自甘堕落去做小人的行为。
English: If you have just noticed that you have done something wrong, you will not hesitate to correct it. This is the way to become an upright gentleman. Clearly knowing that someone is talking about your own shortcomings, you still do not reflect and change, but instead do whatever you want. This is the act of falling to be a villain.
