古文：居易俟命，见危授命，言命者总不外顺受其正；木讷近仁，巧令鲜仁，求仁者即可知从入之方。
现代文：君子在平日没有危险的言行，是在等待时机，一旦国家有难，就会奉献自己的生命去挽救国家的命运，讲命运的人总不外乎将命运承受在应该承受与投注之处。言语不花巧则接近仁德了，反之，话说得好听，脸色讨人喜欢，往往没有什么仁心，寻求仁德的人由此可知该由何处做起才能入仁道。
English: On an ordinary day, a gentleman's words and deeds are not dangerous, he is just waiting for the right time. If the country is in trouble, he will sacrifice his life to save the country's fate. A person who speaks of fate is always nothing more than to bear the fate where it should be borne and bet. If the words are not clever, they are close to benevolence. On the other hand, if the words are pleasant and the face is pleasing, there is often no benevolence. People who seek benevolence can know where to start in order to enter the benevolent path.
