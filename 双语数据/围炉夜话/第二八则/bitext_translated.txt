古文：肯救人坑坎中，便是活菩萨；能脱身牢笼外，便是大英雄。
现代文：愿意费心费力去救助陷于苦难中的人，便如同菩萨再世。能不受社会人情的束缚，超然俗世的人，便足以称之为最杰出的人。
English: Those who are willing to go out of their way to help those in distress are like reincarnated bodhisattvas. Those who are not bound by social sentiment and transcend the mundane world are enough to be called the most outstanding people.
