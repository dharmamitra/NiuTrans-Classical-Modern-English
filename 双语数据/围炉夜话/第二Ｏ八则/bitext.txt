古文：敌加于己，不得已而应之，谓之应兵，兵应者胜；利人土地，谓之贪兵，兵贪者败，此魏相论兵语也。
现代文：敌人来攻打本国，不得已而与之对抗，这叫做 应兵 ，不得已而应战的必然能够胜利。贪图他国国土，叫做 贪兵 ，为贪得他国国土而作战必然会失败，这是魏相论用兵时所讲的话。
English: If the enemy comes to attack our country and we have no choice but to fight against him, this is called military response. If we have no choice but to fight, we will inevitably win. If we covet the land of another country, this is called greed for soldiers. If we fight to covet the land of another country, we will inevitably fail. This is what Wei Xiang said about the use of soldiers.

古文：然岂独用兵为然哉？
现代文：然而又岂止用兵打仗是这样呢？
English: But isn't this more than just using soldiers to fight?

古文：凡人事之成败，皆当作如是观。
现代文：凡是人事的成功或失败，往往也是如此啊！
English: This is often the case with any personnel success or failure!
