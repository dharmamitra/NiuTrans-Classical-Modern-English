古文：自家富贵，不着意里，人家富贵，不着眼里，此是何等胸襟；古人忠孝，不离心头，今人忠孝，不离口头，此是何等志量。
现代文：自身富贵显达了，并不将它放在心上，或时时刻意去显示自己高人一等。别人富贵了，也不将它放在眼里，不生嫉妒羡慕之心，这要何等的胸怀和气度才能做得到？古代的人，常常将忠孝二字放在心中，时刻不忘身体力行。
English: If one's own wealth is conspicuous, one does not take it to heart, or is always intent on showing one's superiority. If someone else is wealthy, one does not take it to heart, and does not feel envy and envy. What kind of mind and spirit is needed to do this? Ancient people often kept the words "loyalty and filial piety" in their hearts, and never forgot to practice them.
