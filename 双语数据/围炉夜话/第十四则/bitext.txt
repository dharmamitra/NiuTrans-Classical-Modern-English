古文：有才必韬藏，如浑金璞玉，暗然而日章也；为学无间断，如流水行云，日进而不已也。
现代文：有才能的人必定勤于修养，不露锋芒，就如没有经过提炼琢磨的金玉一般，虽不炫人耳目，但时间久了便知道其内涵价值了。做学问不能时断时续，应该像行云流水一般经流不息，每天都在不断前进。
English: Talented people must be diligent in cultivation and not show their sharpness, just like a gold nugget that has not been refined. Although it does not dazzle the ears and eyes, it will know its connotation value after a long time. Learning cannot be intermittent, it should flow like a cloud and water, and continue to move forward every day.
