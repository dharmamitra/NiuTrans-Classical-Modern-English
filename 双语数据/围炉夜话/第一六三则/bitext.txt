古文：为善之端无尽，只讲一让字，便人人可行；立身之道何穷，只得一敬字，便事事皆整。
现代文：行善的方法是无穷尽的，只要能讲一个 让 字，人人都可以做得到。处世的道理何止千百，只要做到一个 敬 字，就能够让所有的事情整顿起来。
English: There are endless ways to do good. Anyone can do it as long as they can say the word "respect." There are thousands of ways to behave in the world. As long as you can say the word "respect," you can put everything in order.
