古文：孔子何以恶乡愿，只为他似忠似廉，无非假面孔；孔子何以弃鄙夫，只因他患得患失，尽是俗心肠。
现代文：孔夫子为什么厌恶外貌忠厚相，实则内怀奸诈心的人呢？因为他们只是表面上看来忠厚廉洁，其实内心里并不如此，可见得这种人虚伪矫饰，以假面孔示人。孔夫子为什么厌弃 鄙夫 呢？因为他凡事不知由大体着想，只知为自己个人的利益斤斤计较，得失心太重，是个不知人生精神内涵的俗物。
English: Why does Confucius detest people who look loyal and honest on the outside, but are actually treacherous and deceitful on the inside? Because they only appear to be loyal and honest on the surface, but they are not so on the inside. It can be seen that this kind of person is hypocritical and shows a false face. Why does Confucius abhor the scoundrel? Because he does not know how to think about everything, he only knows how to think about his own personal interests, and he is too heartbroken. He is a vulgarian who does not know the spiritual connotation of life.
