古文：风俗日趋于奢淫，靡所底止，安得有敦古朴之君子，力挽江河；人心日丧其廉耻，渐至消亡，安得有讲名节之大人，光争日月。
现代文：社会的风气日渐奢侈放纵，而且这种现象愈来愈变本加厉，一直没有改善的迹象，如何才能出现一个敦促世人古朴的君子，有着力挽狂澜的能力，使社会恢复原有的质朴；世人已逐渐失去清廉知耻的心，再这样下去，总有一天会完全不知廉耻，如何才能出现一位重视名誉和气节的有德之士，唤醒世人的廉耻心，那么他的功绩就可以万古不没，与日月争辉。
English: The social culture is increasingly extravagant and indulgent, and this phenomenon is getting worse and worse, and there is no sign of improvement. How can there be a gentleman who urges the world to be simple and has the ability to turn back the tide and restore the original simplicity to society? The world has gradually lost its sense of integrity, and if this continues, one day it will be completely shameless. How can there be a virtuous person who values honor and integrity, and awakens the world's sense of integrity, then his merit can last forever, and compete with the sun and the moon.
