古文：鲁如曾子，于道独得其传，可知资性不足限人也；贫如颜子，其乐不因以改，可知境遇不足困人也。
现代文：像曾子那般愚钝的人，却能得孔子真传并阐扬于后世，可见天资不好并不足以限制一个人。像颜渊那么穷的人，却并不因此而失去他的快乐，由此可知遭遇和环境并不足以困住一个人。
English: For someone as dull as Zengzi to be able to have Confucius's teachings passed down and expounded in later generations, it can be seen that a bad natural endowment is not enough to restrict a person. For someone as poor as Yan Yuan, he does not lose his happiness because of it. From this, it can be seen that the encounter and the environment are not enough to trap a person.
