古文：纵容子孙偷安，其后必至耽酒色而败门庭；专教子孙谋利，其后必至争赀财而伤骨肉。
现代文：放纵子孙只图取眼前的安逸享乐，子孙将来一定会沉迷于酒色，败坏门风。专门教子孙谋求利益的人，子孙必定会因争夺财产而彼此伤害。
English: Those who indulge their children and grandchildren only in the pursuit of immediate comfort and enjoyment will surely lead their children and grandchildren to indulge in alcoholism and corrupt morals in the future. Those who specifically teach their children and grandchildren to seek profits will surely cause their children and grandchildren to harm each other due to competition for property.
