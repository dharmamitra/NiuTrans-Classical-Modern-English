古文：意趣清高，利禄不能动也；志量远大，富贵不能淫也。
现代文：心意志趣清雅高尚的人，金钱和禄位是无法改变其心志的；志气广阔高远的人，即使身在富贵之中也不会迷乱心志。
English: For a person with a clear, elegant and noble mind and will, money and position cannot change his mind and will; for a person with a broad and lofty mind and will, even if he is rich, his mind and will will not be confused.
