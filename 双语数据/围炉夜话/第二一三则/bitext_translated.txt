古文：卜筮以龟筮为重，故必龟从筮从乃可言吉。
现代文：古代占卜，是以龟甲和蓍草为主要的占卜工具，因此，一定要龟卜及筮古皆赞同，一件事才可称得上吉。
English: Ancient divination was based on the turtle and the reed as the main divination tools. Therefore, both the turtle and the reed must agree. Only one thing can be called auspicious.

古文：若二者有一不从，或二者俱不从，则宜其有凶无吉矣。
现代文：如果龟和蓍中有一个不赞同，或是两者都不赞同，那么事情便是凶险而无吉兆了。
English: If one of the tortoise and the tortoise does not agree, or if both do not agree, then the situation is dangerous and ominous.

古文：乃洪范稽疑之篇，则于龟从筮逆者，仍曰作内吉。
现代文：但是《尚书》洪范稽疑篇中，则对于龟卜赞同，蓍草不赞同的情形，视为做内面的事吉祥。
English: However, in the "Shang Shu" Hong Fan Ji Ji chapter, the situation that the turtle agrees and the reed grass does not agree is regarded as doing the inner thing is auspicious.

古文：从龟筮共逆于人者，仍曰用静吉。
现代文：即使龟甲和蓍草占卜的结果都与人的意愿相违，仍然要说无所为则有利。
English: Even if the results of turtle shell and reed divination are contrary to people's wishes, it is still beneficial to do nothing.

古文：是知吉凶在人，圣人之垂戒深矣。
现代文：由此可知，吉凶往往决定在自己，圣人已经教训得十分明白了。
English: From this it can be seen that the good and evil are often decided by oneself, and the sage has learned this lesson very clearly.

古文：人诚能作内而不作外，用静而不用作，循分守常，斯亦安往而不吉哉！
现代文：人只要能对内吉外凶的事情在内行之而不在外行之，对于完全与人相违的事守静而不做，安分守己，遵循常道，那么岂不是无往而不利吗？
English: As long as a person is able to inwardly practice the things that are good and beneficial, and not outwardly practice the things that are bad and harmful, and keep quiet and not do the things that are completely contrary to people, keep calm, and follow the common path, then isn't it inevitable and unfavorable?
