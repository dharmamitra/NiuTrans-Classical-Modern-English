现代文：当后辈的天性尚未受到社会恶习感染，而变得浅薄时，教导他是不困难的，因此应以孔子 爱之能勿劳乎 的方式去教导他，而不要过于溺爱，增长了他自我放纵的习性。
English: When the nature of the younger generation has not yet been infected by social vices and has become shallow, it is not difficult to teach him, so he should be taught in a way that Confucius's love can be effortless, rather than being over-coddled and increasing his self-indulgent habits.

古文：子弟习气已坏，教难行也，则守孟子之言以养之，勿轻弃以绝其自新之路。
现代文：当后辈习性已经败坏，不容易教导时，要依孟子 中也养不中，才也养不才 的方式教他，不要轻易地放弃，使他丧失了改过自新的机会。
English: When the habits of the younger generation have been corrupted and it is not easy to teach them, it is necessary to teach them according to the method of Mencius, "If you can't raise them in the middle, you can't raise them in the middle."
