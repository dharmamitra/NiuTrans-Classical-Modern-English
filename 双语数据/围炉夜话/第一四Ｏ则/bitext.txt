现代文：地要竭尽所用，不能浪费；人要全力耕种，不可偷懒，这是种田要谨记的两句话。心要不向外奔；气要不向外散，这是读书的两句诀窍。
English: The land should be used to the full, not wasted; people should do their best to cultivate, not be lazy, these are two sentences to keep in mind when farming. The heart should not run away; the spirit should not be dispersed, these are two tips for reading.
