古文：凡事勿徒委于人，必身体力行，方能有济；凡事不可执于己，必集思广益，乃罔后艰。
现代文：不要凡事都依赖他人，必须亲自去做，才能对自己有所帮助。也不要事事只凭自己的意思去做，最好参考大家的意见和智慧，免得后遇到不能克服的困难。
English: Don't rely on others for everything, you have to do it yourself to be able to help yourself. Also, don't do everything on your own, it's best to refer to everyone's opinions and wisdom, lest you encounter insurmountable difficulties later.
