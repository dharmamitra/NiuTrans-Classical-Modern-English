古文：神传于目，而目则有胞，闭之可以养神也；祸出于口，而口则有唇，阖之可以防祸也。
现代文：人的精神往往由眼睛来传达，而眼睛则有上下眼皮，合起来可以养精神。祸事往往由说话造成，而嘴巴明明有两片嘴辱，闭起来就可以避免闯祸。
English: The spirit of a person is often conveyed by the eyes, and the eyes have upper and lower eyelids, which together can raise the spirit. Misfortune is often caused by speech, and the mouth clearly has two lips. If you close it, you can avoid getting into trouble.
