古文：与其使乡党有誉言，不如令乡党无怨言；与其为子孙谋产业，不如教子孙习恒业。
现代文：与其让邻里对你称赞有加，不如让乡里对你毫无抱怨。与其替子孙谋求田产财富，倒不如让他学习可以长久谋生的本领。
English: It is better to have no complaints about you in the countryside than to be praised by your neighbors. It is better to learn the skills to make a long-term living than to seek agricultural wealth for your children and grandchildren.
