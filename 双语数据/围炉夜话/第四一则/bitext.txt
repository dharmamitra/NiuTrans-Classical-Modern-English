古文：误用聪明，何若一生守拙；滥交朋友，不如终日读书。
现代文：把聪明用错了地方，还不如一辈子谨守愚拙，至少不会出错。随便交朋友，倒不如整天闭门读书。
English: If you use your intelligence in the wrong place, it's better to stay stupid for the rest of your life, at least you won't make mistakes. It's better to make friends casually than to study all day behind closed doors.
