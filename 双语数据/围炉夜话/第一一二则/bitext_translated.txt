古文：图功未晚，亡羊尚可补牢；浮慕无成，羡鱼何如结网。
现代文：想要有所成就，任何时候都不嫌晚，因为就算羊跑掉了，及时修补羊圈，事情还是可以补救的。光是羡慕是没有用的，想要得到水中的鱼，不如尽快地结网。
English: If you want to achieve something, it's never too late, because even if the sheep run away, you can still fix the sheep pen in time. It's no use being envious, if you want to get the fish in the water, it's better to cast the net as soon as possible.
