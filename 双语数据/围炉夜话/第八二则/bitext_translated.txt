古文：和为祥气，骄为衰气，相人者不难以一望而知；善是吉星，恶是凶星，推命者岂必因五行而定。
现代文：平和是祥瑞的气象，骄傲是衰败的气象，看相的人一眼就能看出来，并不困难。善良就是吉星，恶毒就是凶星，算命的人哪里必需要按照五行才能论断吉凶呢？
English: Peace is the weather of auspiciousness, and pride is the weather of decline. It is not difficult for those who look at the stars to see it at a glance. Goodness is a lucky star, and evil is a bad star. Why do fortune-tellers need to follow the five elements in order to judge good and evil?
