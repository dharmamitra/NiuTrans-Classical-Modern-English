古文：君子以名教为乐，岂如嵇阮之逾闲；圣人以悲悯为心，不取沮溺之忘世。
现代文：读书人应该以钻研圣人之教为乐事，怎么能像嵇康、阮籍等人，逾越礼教，放浪形骸？圣人抱着悲天悯人之胸怀，关心民生的疾苦，不能效法长沮、桀溺的避世独居，不理世事。
English: Readers should enjoy delving into the teachings of the saints. How can they surpass the rituals and wander like the people of Jiankang and Ruanji? The saints hold a compassionate heart and are concerned about the hardships of the people's livelihood. They cannot follow the example of the long-suffering and self-absorbed people who avoid the world, live alone and ignore the world.
