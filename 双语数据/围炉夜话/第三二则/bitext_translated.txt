古文：古人比父子为桥梓，比兄弟为花萼，比朋友为芝兰，敦伦者，当即物穷理也；今人称诸生曰秀才，称贡生曰明经，称举人曰孝廉，为士者，当顾名思义也。
现代文：古时候的人，把 父子 比喻为乔和梓木，把 兄弟 比喻为花与萼，将 朋友 比为芝兰香草，因此，有心想敦睦人伦的人，由万物的事理便可推见人伦之理。现在的人称读书人为 秀才 ，称被举荐入太学的生员为 明经 ，又叫举人为 孝廉 ，因此读书人可以就这些名称，明白自己应有的内涵。
English: In ancient times, people likened father and son to Qiao and Zi Mu, brothers to flowers and calyxes, and friends to herbs. Therefore, people who have the desire to harmonize human relations can deduce the principles of human relations from the principles of all things. Nowadays, people call readers "excellence," call students who have been recommended to enter Taiyuan University as "Mingjing," and call people who have been recommended as "filial piety." Therefore, readers can understand their own connotation with these names.
