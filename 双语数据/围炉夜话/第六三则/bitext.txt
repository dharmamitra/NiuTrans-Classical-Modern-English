古文：富贵易生祸端，必忠厚谦恭，才无大患；衣禄原有定数，必节俭简省，乃可久延。
现代文：财富与显贵，都容易招来祸害，一定要诚实宽厚地待人，谦虚恭敬地自处，这样才不会发生灾祸。个人一生的福禄都有定数，所以要节约朴素，才能使福禄更长久。
English: Both wealth and nobility are likely to bring disaster. We must be honest and generous to others, and humble and respectful to ourselves, so that disasters do not occur. There is a fixed number of blessings in a person's life, so we must be frugal and simple in order to make the blessings last longer.
