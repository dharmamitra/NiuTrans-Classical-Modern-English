古文：不镜于水，而镜于人，则吉凶可鉴也；不蹶于山，而蹶于垤，则细微宜防也。
现代文：如果不以水为镜，而以人为镜来反照自己，那么，许多事情的吉凶祸福便可以明白了。在高山上不易跌倒，在小土堆上却易跌倒，由此可知，愈是细微的地方，愈要谨慎小心。
English: If you do not use water as a mirror, but reflect yourself with a human mirror, then you can understand the fortunes and misfortunes of many things. It is not easy to fall on a high mountain, but it is easy to fall on a small mound, which shows that the finer the place, the more careful you should be.
