古文：莲朝开而暮合，至不能合，则将落矣，富贵而无收敛意者，尚其鉴之。
现代文：莲花早晨开放，到了夜晚便合起来，到了不能再合起来时，就是快要凋落了。富贵而不知收敛的人，最好能够以此为鉴。
English: The lotus flower opens in the morning, closes at night, and when it can no longer close, it is about to fall. Those who are rich and do not know how to converge, it is best to follow this example.

古文：草春荣而冬枯，至于极枯，则又生矣，困穷而有振兴志者，亦如是也。
现代文：春天时，草木繁茂，到了冬天就干枯了，等完全枯萎的时候，又到了草木再度发芽的春天了，身处穷困的境地而想奋起的人，应当像野草一样自我勉励。
English: In spring, the grass grows luxuriantly, in winter it withers, and when it is completely withered, it is spring again, when the grass sprouts again. People who are in a poor situation and want to rise up should encourage themselves like weeds.
