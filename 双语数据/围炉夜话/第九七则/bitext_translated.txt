古文：川学海而至海，故谋道者不可有止心；莠非苗而似苗，故穷理者不可无真见。
现代文：河川学习大海的兼容并蓄，最后终能汇流入海。所以，一个人追求学问与道德的心也应该像这样，永不止息。田里的莠草长得很像禾苗，可是它并不是禾苗，所以，深究事理的人不能没有真知灼见，否则便容易被蒙蔽。
English: Rivers learn from the sea how to be inclusive, and eventually they can flow into the sea. Therefore, a person's pursuit of knowledge and morality should also be like this and never stop. The reeds in the field look like seedlings, but they are not seedlings. Therefore, a person who is a deep reasoner must have insight, otherwise he will be easily deceived.
