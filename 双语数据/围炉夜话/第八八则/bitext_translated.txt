古文：有生资，不加学习，气质究难化也；慎大德，不矜细行，形迹终可疑也。
现代文：天资很好，如果后天不加以学习，脾气性情还是很难有所改进的。只在大的德行上留心谨慎，却在小节上不加以爱惜，到底让人对他的言行不能信任。
English: The talent is very good, and if it is not learned, it is still difficult to improve the temperament and disposition. It is only prudent to pay attention to the major virtues, but not to cherish the minor ones. In the end, people cannot trust his words and deeds.
