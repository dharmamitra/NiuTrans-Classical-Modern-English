古文：交朋友增体面，不如交朋友益身心；教子弟求显荣，不如教子弟立品行。
现代文：交朋友如果是为了增加自己的面子，倒不如交一些真正对我们身心有益的朋友。教导后辈去追求荣华富贵，倒不如教导他们做人应有的品格和行为。
English: If making friends is to increase one's own face, it is better to make some friends who are truly beneficial to our body and mind. It is better to teach the younger generation to pursue glory and wealth, and to teach them the character and behavior they should have.
