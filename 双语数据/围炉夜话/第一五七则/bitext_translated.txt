古文：齐家先修身，言行不可不慎；读书在明理，识见不可不高。
现代文：治理家庭首先要提高自身修养，在言行方面一定要处处谨慎无失。读书的目的在于明达事理，一定要使自己的见识高超而不低劣。
English: To govern a family, it is first necessary to improve one's self-cultivation. In terms of words and deeds, one must be cautious at all times. The purpose of reading is to understand things, and one must make one's knowledge superior rather than inferior.
