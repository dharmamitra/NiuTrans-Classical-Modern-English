古文：尧舜大圣，而生朱均；瞽鲧至愚，而生舜禹；揆以馀广馀殃之理，似觉难凭。
现代文：尧和舜都是古代的大圣人，却生了丹朱和商均这样不肖的儿子；瞽和鲧都是愚昧的人，却生了舜和禹这样的圣人；若以善人遗及子孙德泽，恶人遗及子孙祸殃的道理来说，似乎不太说得通。
English: Yao and Zou were both great sages in ancient times, yet they gave birth to such unattractive sons as Dan Zhu and Shangjun; Yao and Zou were both foolish people, yet they gave birth to such sages as Zou and Yu; if we take the principle that good people leave behind their children and descendants, Dezhe, and evil people leave behind their children and descendants, Qubao, it seems to be difficult to make sense of it.

古文：然尧舜之圣，初未尝因朱均而灭；瞽鲧之愚，亦不能因舜禹而掩，所以人贵自立也。
现代文：然而尧舜的圣明，并不因后代的不贤而有所毁损；而瞽鲧那般的愚昧，也无法被舜禹的贤能所掩盖，所以人最重要的是能自立自强。
English: However, the sacredness of  is not damaged by the wickedness of future generations; and the foolishness of  cannot be covered by the wisdom of, so the most important thing for people is to be able to stand up for themselves.
