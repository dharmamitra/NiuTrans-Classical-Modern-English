古文：正而过则迂，直而过则拙，故迂拙之人，犹不失为正直。
现代文：做人太过方正就显得不通世故，行事太过直率就显得有些笨拙，但这两种人还不失为正直的人。
English: To be too upright is to appear unsophisticated, to act too bluntly is to appear somewhat clumsy, but these two kinds of people are also honest people.

古文：高或入于虚，华或入于浮，而虚浮之士，究难指为高华。
现代文：理想太过高远有时会成为空想，重视奢华有时会变得虚浮，这两种人到底不能成为真正高明美好的人。
English: An ideal that is too lofty can sometimes become a fantasy, an emphasis on luxury can sometimes become vain, and these two kinds of people can never become truly brilliant and beautiful people.
