古文：守分安贫，何等清闲，而好事者，偏自寻烦恼；持盈保泰，总须忍让，而恃强者，乃自取灭亡。
现代文：能持守本分而安贫乐道，这是多么清闲自在的事，然而喜欢兴造事端的人，偏偏要自寻烦恼。在事业极盛时不骄不满，凡事忍让，才能长久不衰，要是仗势欺人，等于是自取灭亡。
English: To be able to do one's duty and live in peace and contentment, this is a matter of leisure and ease. However, those who like to stir up trouble should seek their own troubles. When one's career is at its peak, one should not be arrogant and dissatisfied, but should be tolerant of everything in order to be able to endure for a long time. If one tries to bully others, it is tantamount to self-defeat.
