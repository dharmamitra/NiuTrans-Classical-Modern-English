古文：以汉高祖之英明，知吕后必杀戚姬，而不能救止，盖其祸已成也；以陶朱公智计，知长男必杀仲子，而不能保全，殆其罪难宥乎？
现代文：像汉高祖那么雄才大略的帝王，明知在他死后吕后会杀死他最心爱的戚夫人，却无力挽救阻止，这是因为这个祸事已经造成了；而像陶朱公那么足智多谋的人，明知他的长子非但救不了次子，反而会害了次子，却无法保全此事，大概是因为次子的罪本来就让人难以原谅吧！
English: A magnanimous emperor like Han Gaozu, knowing that after his death Lyu Hou would kill his most beloved kinswoman, was powerless to prevent it, because the evil had already been done; while a resourceful man like Tao Zhu Gong, knowing that his eldest son would not only fail to save his second son, but would actually harm his second son, was unable to prevent it, probably because the second son's sin is inherently difficult to forgive.
