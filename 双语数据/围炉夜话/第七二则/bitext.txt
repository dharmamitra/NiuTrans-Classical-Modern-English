古文：俭可养廉，觉茅舍竹篱，自饶清趣；静能生悟，即鸟啼花落，都是化机。
现代文：勤俭可以修养一个人廉洁的品性，就算住在竹篱围绕的茅屋，也有它清雅的趣味。在寂静中，容易领悟到天地之间道理，即使鸟儿鸣啼，花开花落，也能领悟出造化的生机。
English: Diligence and frugality can cultivate a person's incorruptible character. Even if you live in a thatched cottage surrounded by a bamboo hedge, it has its elegant taste. In silence, it is easy to understand the truth between heaven and earth. Even if birds chirp and flowers bloom, you can also understand the vitality of creation.

古文：一生快活皆庸福，万种艰辛出伟人。
现代文：能一辈子快乐无忧的生活，这只不过是平凡人的福分；经历万种艰难困苦，才能成就一个伟人。
English: To be able to live a happy and carefree life for the rest of one's life is nothing more than an ordinary person's blessing; to experience all kinds of hardships and difficulties is to become a great man.
