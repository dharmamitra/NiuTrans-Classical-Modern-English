古文：聪明勿使外散，古人有纩以塞耳，旒以蔽目者矣；耕读何妨兼营，古人有出而负耒，入而横经者矣。
现代文：聪明的人要懂得收敛，不要向外炫耀，古人曾有用丝绵塞耳、用玉串遮眼来掩饰自己的聪明；耕田和读书可以兼顾，古人曾有日出耕作、日暮读书的行为。
English: Clever people should know how to restrain themselves and not show off to the outside world. The ancients used to cover their ears with silk and their eyes with beads to disguise their cleverness. They could combine farming and reading. The ancients had the behavior of farming at sunrise and reading at dusk.
