古文：一言足以召大祸，故古人守口如瓶，惟恐其覆坠也；一行足以玷终身，故古人饬躬若璧，惟恐有瑕疵也。
现代文：一句不慎重的话就可以招来大祸，所以古人言谈十分谨慎，唯恐招来杀身毁家的大祸。一件错事足以玷污一生的名节，所以古人守身如玉，行事非常小心，惟恐做错事，会让自己终身抱憾！
English: One careless word can bring disaster, so the ancients were very careful in their speech, lest they bring disaster to themselves and their families. One wrong deed is enough to tarnish the name of a lifetime, so the ancients were very careful in their actions, lest they do something wrong and regret it for the rest of their lives!
