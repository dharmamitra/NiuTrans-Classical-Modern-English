古文：打算精明，自谓自计，然败祖父之家声者，必此人也；朴实浑厚，初无甚奇，然培子孙之元气者，必此人也。
现代文：凡事都斤斤计较、毫不吃亏的人，自以为很成功，然而败坏了祖宗遗留下来的良好名声的，一定是这种人。诚实俭朴而又敦厚待人的人，刚开始虽然不见他有什么奇特的表现，然而使子孙能够有一种纯厚之气，历久不衰的，就是这种人。
English: The man who thinks he is a success, but who ruins the good name of his ancestors, the man who is careful in all things, who suffers no loss, the man who is honest, frugal, and generous to others, and who, though at first he may not appear to be so, yet gives to his children and grandchildren a pure and lasting character, such is the man.
