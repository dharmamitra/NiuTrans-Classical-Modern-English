古文：有守虽无所展布，而其节不挠，故与有猷有为而并重；立言即未经起行，而于人有益，故与立功立德而并传。
现代文：能谨守道义而不变节，虽然对道义并无推展之功，却有守节不屈之志，所以和有贡献有作为是同等重要的。在文字上宣扬道理，虽然并未以行为动来加以表现，但是已使闻而信者得到裨益，因此和直接建立事业与功德是同样不朽而为人所传颂的。
English: To be able to keep the moral law and not change it, although there is no merit in promoting the moral law, but there is a desire to keep the moral law and not give in to it, so it is equally important to have contributions and actions. To preach the truth in writing, although it is not expressed by actions, but it has benefited those who heard and believed, so it is as immortal and praised by people as the direct establishment of the cause and merit.
