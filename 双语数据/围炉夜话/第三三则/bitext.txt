古文：父兄有善行，子弟学之或不肖；父兄有恶行，子弟学之则无不肖；可知父兄教子弟，必正其身以率子，无庸徒事言词也。
现代文：但是如果长辈有不好的行为，晚辈倒是一学就会，没有不像的。由此可知，长辈教导晚辈，一定要先端正自己的行为，为他们做好表率，这样他们才能学得好，而不是只在言辞上白费工夫，不能以身作则。
English: But if the elders have bad behavior, the younger generation will learn from it, there is no difference. It can be seen that the elders must correct their behavior and set an example for the younger generation, so that they can learn well, rather than wasting their time on rhetoric and cannot lead by example.

古文：君子有过行，小人嫉之不能容；君子无过行，小人嫉之亦不能容；可知君子处小人，必平其气以待之，不可稍形激切也。
现代文：有道德的人行为若稍有超过或偏失，一些无德之人因为嫉妒，一定无法容忍而群起攻击。但是有德之人即使不犯过失，小人也不见得能容他。由此可知，有道德的君子和无道德的小人相处时，一定要平心静气地对待他们，不可过于急切的责骂他们。
English: When a virtuous man acts a little too much or errs, some unvirtuous people, out of jealousy, must be unable to tolerate him and attack him en masse. But a virtuous man, even if he does not commit a fault, is not likely to be tolerated by a villain. Thus, when a virtuous gentleman and an unethical villain get along, they must be treated calmly, and they must not be scolded too eagerly.
