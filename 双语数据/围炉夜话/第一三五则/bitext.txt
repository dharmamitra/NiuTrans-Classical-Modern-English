古文：德泽太薄，家有好事，未必是好事，得意者何可自矜；天道最公，人能苦心，断不负苦心，为善者须当自信。
现代文：自身的品德不高，恩泽不厚，即使家中有好事降临，未必真是幸运。得意的人又怎么能自以为了不起呢？上天是最公平的，人能尽心尽力，一定不会白费，做好事的人尤其要有自信。
English: One's own moral character is not high, one's grace is not thick, even if something good happens at home, it may not be really lucky. How can a person who is proud of himself be great? Heaven is the fairest, if you can do your best, it will not be in vain, and those who do good things should be especially confident.
