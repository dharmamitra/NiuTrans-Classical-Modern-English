古文：势利人装腔做调，都只在体面上铺张，可知其百为皆假；虚浮人指东画西，全不向身心内打算，定卜其一事无成。
现代文：势利的人都喜欢装模作样，只知道在表面上铺张，由此可以看透他所作所为都是虚假的。不切实际的人言不及义，东拉西扯，心中没有一点目标，这样的人一定什么都无法完成。
English: Snobbish people like to put on airs and graces. They only know how to put on airs and graces on the surface, which allows them to see through the falsity of everything they do. Unrealistic people don't mean what they say, they ramble on and on, and they don't have a single goal in mind. Such people will never be able to accomplish anything.
