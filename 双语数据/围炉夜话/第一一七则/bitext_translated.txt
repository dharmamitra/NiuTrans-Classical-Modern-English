古文：凡遇事物突来，必熟思审处，恐贻后悔；不幸家庭衅起，须忍让曲全，勿失旧欢。
现代文：遇到突发的事情，一定要仔细地思考，慎重地处理，以免事后反悔；家中不幸起了瑕隙，必须尽量忍让，委曲求全，不要使过去的情感破坏无遗。
English: In the event of an emergency, you must think carefully and deal with it carefully, so as not to regret it afterwards; unfortunately, there is a flaw in your home, you must try to tolerate it, compromise and seek perfection, and do not let the past emotions destroy everything.
