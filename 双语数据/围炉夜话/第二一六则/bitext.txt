古文：古之克孝者多矣，独称虞舜为大孝，盖能为其难也；古之有才者众矣，独称周公为美才，盖能本于德也。
现代文：自古以来能够尽孝道的人很多，然而独独称虞舜为大孝之人，是因为他能在孝道上做到别人做不到的事情。自古以来有才能的人很多，然而单单称赞周公美才，是因为周公的才能是以道德为根本。
English: Since ancient times, there have been many people who have been able to fulfill their filial duty. However, the reason why Yu Gan is called a great filial son is because he can do things that others cannot do in terms of filial duty. There have been many talented people since ancient times, but they only praised Zhou Gong's beauty because Zhou Gong's talent is based on morality.
