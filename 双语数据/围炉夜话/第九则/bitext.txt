古文：善谋生者，但令长幼内外，勤修恒业，而不必富其家；善处事者，但就是非可否，审定章程，而不必利于己。
现代文：擅长维持生计的人，并不是有什么新奇的花招，只是使家中年纪无论大小，事情无分内外，每个人都能就其本分，有恒地将分内的事完成，这样做虽不一定能使家道大富，却能在稳定中成长。长于办理事务的人，不一定有奇特的才能，只是就事情如何才能完成，在可行与不可行处加以判断，订立一个办理的规则和程序，而且，并不一定要对自己有利益才去做。
English: People who are good at making a living do not have any new tricks, but just make everyone in the family, no matter how old or young, no matter what is inside or outside, be able to fulfill their duties and consistently complete their duties. Although this may not necessarily make the family rich, it can grow in stability. People who are good at doing business do not necessarily have special talents, but they just judge how things can be done, where they are feasible and where they are not feasible, and set up a management rule and procedure. Moreover, they do not necessarily do it for their own benefit.
