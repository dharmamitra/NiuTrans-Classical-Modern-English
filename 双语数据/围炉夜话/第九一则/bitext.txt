古文：为乡邻解纷争，使得和好如初，即化人之事也；为世俗谈因果，使知报应不爽，亦劝善之方也。
现代文：替乡里的邻居解决纠纷，使他们和最初一样友好，这便是教化他人的善事。向世俗的人解说因果报应的事，使他们知道 善有善报，恶有恶报 的道理，这也是一种劝人为善的方法。
English: Resolving disputes on behalf of neighbors in the countryside and making them as friendly as they were in the beginning is the good deed of educating others. Explaining the matter of karma to worldly people, so that they know the principle that good has a good return and evil has a bad return, is also a method of persuading people to be good.
