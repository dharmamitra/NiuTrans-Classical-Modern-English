古文：兄弟相师友，天伦之乐莫大焉；闺门若朝廷，家法之严可知也。
现代文：兄弟只见彼此为师友，伦常之乐的极致就是如此。家规如朝廷一般严谨，由此可知家法严厉。
English: Brothers only see each other as mentors and friends, and this is the ultimate in the joys of morality. The family rules are as strict as those of the imperial court, which indicates that the family law is strict.
