古文：富不肯读书，贵不肯积德，错过可惜也；少不肯事长，愚不肯亲贤，不祥莫大焉！
现代文：在富有的时候不肯好好读书，在显贵的时候不能积下德业，错过了这富贵可为之时实在可惜。年少的时候不肯敬奉长辈，愚昧却又不肯向贤人请教，这是很不祥的预兆！
English: When you are rich, you don't want to study well. When you are famous, you can't accumulate virtue. It's a pity that you missed this rich time. When you are young, you don't want to respect your elders. When you are stupid, you don't want to ask wise people for advice. This is a very bad omen!
