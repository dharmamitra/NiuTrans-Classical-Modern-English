古文：友以成德也，人而无友，则孤陋寡闻，德不能成矣；学以愈愚也，人而不学，则昏昧无知，愚不能愈矣。
现代文：朋友可以帮助自己德业进步，人如果没有朋友，则学识浅薄，见闻不广，德业就无法提高；学习是为了让自己不愚昧，人如果不学习，则一定会愚昧无知，愚昧的毛病永远都不能治好。
English: Friends can help one to improve one's virtue. If one does not have friends, one's knowledge is shallow and one cannot improve one's virtue. One should study in order not to be ignorant. If one does not study, one is bound to be ignorant, and the disease of ignorance can never be cured.
