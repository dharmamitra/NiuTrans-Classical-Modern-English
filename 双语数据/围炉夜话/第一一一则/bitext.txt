古文：人知佛老为异端，不知凡背乎经常者，皆异端也；人知扬墨为邪说，不知凡涉于虚诞者，皆邪说也。
现代文：人们都认为佛家和老子的学说不同于儒家的正统思想，然而却不知凡是于常理有所不合的，都有背于儒家思想。人们都知道杨朱和墨子的学说是旁门左道，却不知只要内容荒诞虚妄的，都是不正确的学说。
English: People all agree that the doctrines of Buddhism and Lao Tzu are different from the orthodox thought of Confucianism, but they do not know that anything that is inconsistent with common sense is contrary to Confucianism. People know that the doctrines of Yang Zhu and Mozi are irrelevant, but they do not know that as long as the content is absurd and false, they are incorrect doctrines.
