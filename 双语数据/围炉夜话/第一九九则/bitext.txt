古文：家之富厚者，积田产以遗子孙，子孙未必能保；不如广积阴功，使天眷其德，或可少延。
现代文：家中富有的人，将积聚的田产留给子孙，但子孙未必能守住它；倒不如多行善事，使上天眷顾他的阴德，也许可以让子孙的福分因此得到延长。
English: The rich man in the family will leave the accumulated farmland to his descendants, but the descendants may not be able to keep it; rather, it is better to do more good deeds, so that the heavens will take care of his virtue, and perhaps the children's blessings can be extended.

古文：家之贫穷者，谋奔走以给衣食，衣食未必能充；何若自谋本业，知民生在勤，定当有济。
现代文：家中贫穷的人，想尽办法来筹措衣食，衣食却未必获得充足；倒不如在工作上多加努力，若能知道民生的根本在于勤奋，那么多少会有所帮助，而不必四处求人。
English: Poor people at home try their best to raise food and clothing, but they may not get enough food and clothing; it is better to work hard at work. If you can know that the foundation of people's livelihood is hard work, then it will help somewhat, without having to ask for people everywhere.
