古文：王者不令人放生，而无故却不杀生，则物命可惜也；圣人不责人无过，唯多方诱之改过，庶人心可回也。
现代文：做君王的，虽然不至于下令叫人多多放生，但是也不会无缘无故残杀生灵，因为这样至少可以教人珍惜生命。圣人不会要求人一定不能犯错，只是用各种方法，引导众人改正错误的行为，因为如此，才能使众人的心由恶转善，由失道转为正道。
English: Although a king would not order that many people be set free, he would not kill living beings for no reason, because this would at least teach people to value life. A saint would not demand that people must not make mistakes, but would use various methods to guide people to correct their wrong actions. Because of this, it is possible to turn people's hearts from evil to good, from the wrong path to the right path.
