古文：为人循矩度，而不见精神，则登场之傀儡也；做事守章程，而不知权变，则依样之葫芦也。
现代文：一个人如果只知依着规矩做事，而不知规矩的精神所在，那么就和戏台上的木偶没有两样；做事如果只知墨守成规，而不知通权达变，那么只不过是照样模枋罢了。
English: If a person only knows how to do things according to the rules, but does not know the spirit of the rules, then he is no different from the puppets on the stage; if he only knows how to do things according to the rules, but does not know how to achieve change, then it is just the same.
