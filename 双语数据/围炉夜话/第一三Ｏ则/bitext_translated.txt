古文：有不可及之志，必有不可及之功；有不忍言之心，必有不忍言之祸。
现代文：一个人有他人所不能及的志向，必然能建立他人所不能及的功业。对人对事若发现错误而不忍心去指责、纠正，那么必然会因为不忍心去说而造成祸害。
English: If a person has an ambition that others cannot match, he will surely be able to build a career that others cannot match. If he cannot bear to criticize and correct others when he finds a mistake, then he will inevitably cause harm because he cannot bear to say it.
