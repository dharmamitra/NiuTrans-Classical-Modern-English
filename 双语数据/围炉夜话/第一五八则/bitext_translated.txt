古文：桃实之肉暴于外，不自吝惜，人得取而食之；食之而种其核，犹饶生气焉，此可见积善者有余庆也。
现代文：桃子的果肉暴露在外，毫不吝啬于给人食用，因此人们在取食之后，会将果核种和土中，使其生生不息，由此可见多做善事的人，自然会有遗及子孙的德泽。
English: The flesh of the peach is exposed to the outside world, and people do not hesitate to give it to others to eat. Therefore, after eating, people will plant the core of the peach in the soil so that it will continue to grow. This shows that people who do more good deeds will naturally have the virtues of their children and grandchildren.

古文：粟实之肉秘于内，深自防护，人乃剖而食之；食之而弃其壳，绝无生理矣，此可知多藏者必厚亡也。
现代文：粟子的果肉深藏在壳内，好像尽力在保护一般，人们必须用刀剖开才能吃它，吃完了再将壳丢弃，因此无法生根发芽，由此亦可明白凡是吝于付出的人，往往是自取灭亡。
English: The flesh of the poppy is deeply hidden in the shell, as if trying to protect it. People have to cut it open with a knife to eat it, and then discard the shell after eating, so it cannot take root and germinate. It can also be understood that those who are reluctant to pay are often self-destructive.
