古文：人虽无艰难之时，却不可忘艰难之境；世虽有侥幸之事，断不可存侥幸之心。
现代文：人即使处在顺遂的环境中，也不要忘记人生还有逆境的存在。世上虽然偶然会有意外收获的例子，但是心中还是不要抱着不劳而获的想法。
English: Even if you are in a prosperous environment, don't forget that there is adversity in life. Although there are occasional examples of windfall gains in the world, don't hold the idea of getting something for nothing in your heart.
