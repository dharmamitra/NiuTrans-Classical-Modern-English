古文：隐微之衍，即干宪典，所以君子怀刑也；技艺之末，无益身心，所以君子务本也。
现代文：一些不留意的过失，很可能就会违反法度，所以君子行事，常在心中留礼法，以免犯错。技艺是学问的末流，对身心并无改善的力量，所以君子重视根本的学问，而不把精力浪费在旁枝末节上。
English: Some careless mistakes are likely to violate the law, so the gentleman acts first, and often keeps the etiquette in his heart to avoid making mistakes. Skill is the last stream of learning, and there is no power to improve the body and mind, so the gentleman attaches importance to the fundamental knowledge, and does not waste his energy on side branches.
