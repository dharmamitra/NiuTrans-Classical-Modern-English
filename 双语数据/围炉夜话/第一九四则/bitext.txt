古文：紫阳补大学格致之章，恐人误入虚无，而必使之即物穷理，所以维正教也；阳明取孟子良知之说，恐人徒事记诵，而必使之反己省心，所以救末流也。
现代文：朱子注《大学·格物》一章时，特别加以补充说明，只担心学习的人误解而入于虚无之道，所以需要人多去穷尽事物之理，目的是在于维护孔门的正教。王阳明取了孟子的 良知良能 之说，只是害怕学习的人只会背诵，所以一定要教导他们反观自己的本心，这是为了挽回那些学圣贤道理只知死读书的人而设的。
English: When Zhu Zi annotated the chapter of "University · Lattice," he added a special explanation that people who are only worried about learning misunderstand and enter the path of nothingness, so more people are needed to exhaust the truth of things. The purpose is to maintain the orthodoxy of Confucius. Wang Yangming took Mencius's "Conscience and Virtue" to say that people who are afraid of learning can only memorize, so they must be taught to reflect on their original mind. This is designed to save those who only know how to read when they are dead.
