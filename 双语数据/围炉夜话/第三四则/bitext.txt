古文：守身不敢妄为，恐贻羞于父母；创业还须深虑，恐贻害于子孙。
现代文：一个人洁身自爱而不敢胡作非为，是怕自己做了不好的事情，会使父母蒙羞。开始创立事业时一定要深思熟虑，考虑周全，以免种下祸根，给子孙留下祸患。
English: A person who loves himself and does not dare to do anything wrong is afraid that he has done something bad and will bring shame to his parents. When starting a business, he must be thoughtful and considerate, so as not to sow the roots of evil and leave a disaster for his children and grandchildren.
