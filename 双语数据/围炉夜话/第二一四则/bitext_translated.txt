古文：每见勤苦之人绝无痨疾，显达之士多出寒门，此亦盈虚消长之机，自然之理也。
现代文：常常看见勤勉刻苦的人绝对不会得痨病，而显名闻达的君子往往是劳苦出身，这便是盈则亏、消则长，也是大自然本有的道理。
English: It is often seen that diligent and hard-working people will never get ill, and the famous and well-known gentlemen are often born from hard work. This is the reason why gain is loss and loss is long, and is also the inherent reason of nature.
