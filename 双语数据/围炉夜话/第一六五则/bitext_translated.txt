古文：治术必本儒术者，念念皆仁厚也；今人不及古人者，事事皆虚浮也。
现代文：治理国家之所以必定要本于儒家的方法，主要的原因乃在于儒家的治国之道都出于仁家宽厚之心。现在的人之所以不如古人，是因为现在的人所做的事情都十分不实在，不稳定。
English: The main reason why the governance of the country must be based on the Confucian method is that the Confucian way of governing the country is out of benevolence. The reason why people today are not as good as the ancients is because the things people do today are very unreal and unstable.
