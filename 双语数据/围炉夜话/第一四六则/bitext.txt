古文：天虽好生，亦难救求死之人；人能造福，即可邀悔祸之天。
现代文：上天虽然希望万物都充满生机，却也无法救一心求死的人。人如果能自求多福，就可使原本将要发生的灾祸不发生，就像得到了上天的赦免一般。
English: Although God wants all things to be full of vitality, He cannot save a person who is bent on death. If a person can ask for many blessings, he can prevent the disaster that was originally going to happen, just as if he had received God's forgiveness.
