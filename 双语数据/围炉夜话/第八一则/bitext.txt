古文：数虽有定，而君子但求其理，理既得，数亦难违；变固宜防，而君子但守其常，常无失，变亦能御。
现代文：运数虽有一定的限度，但君子只求所做的事合理，若能合理，运数也不会违背理数。凡事虽然应该防止意外，但君子如果能持守常道，只要常道不失去，再多的变化也能御防。
English: Although there is a certain limit to the number of operations, a gentleman only asks that what is done is reasonable. If it can be reasonable, the number of operations will not violate the rational number. Although accidents should be prevented in all things, if a gentleman can maintain the usual way, as long as the usual way is not lost, no more changes can be prevented.
