古文：颜子之不校，孟子之自反，是贤人处横逆之方；子贡之无谄，原思之坐弦，是贤人守贫穷之法。
现代文：遇到有人冒犯时，颜渊不与人计较，孟子则时常自我反省，这是君子在遇人蛮横不讲理时的相处之道。在贫贱时，子贡不去阿谀富人，子思则依然弹琴自娱，这是君子安贫乐道的方法。
English: When encountering someone who offends, Yan Yuan does not care about others, Mencius often self-reflects, which is the gentleman's way of getting along with people when they are rude and unreasonable. When poor, Zigong does not go to the rich, Zisi still plays the piano to entertain himself, which is the gentleman's way of poverty alleviation.
