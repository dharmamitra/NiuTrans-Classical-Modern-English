古文：明犯国法，罪累岂能幸逃；白得人财，赔偿还要加倍。
现代文：明明知道而故意触犯国法，哪里能侥幸地逃避法律的制裁？平白无故地取得他人财物，偿还的要比得到的更加多几倍。
English: If you knowingly and intentionally violate the laws of the country, how can you possibly escape the sanctions of the law? If you take someone else's property without any reason, you have to pay back several times more than what you get.
