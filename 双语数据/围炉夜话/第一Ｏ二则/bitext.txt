古文：陶侃运甓官斋，其精勤可企而及也；谢安围棋别墅，其镇定非学而能也。
现代文：晋代的名臣陶侃，在闲暇的时候仍然运砖修习勤劳，这种精勤的态度是我们可以学习并做得到的。晋代名相谢安，在面临大敌时，仍然能和朋友从容不迫地下棋，这种镇定的功夫，就不是我们学得来的。
English: Tao Kan, a famous minister of the Jin Dynasty, still carried bricks and practiced hard work in his spare time. This diligent attitude is something we can learn and do.
