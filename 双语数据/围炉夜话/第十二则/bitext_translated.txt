古文：人心统耳目官骸，而于百体为君，必随处见神明之宰；人面合眉眼鼻口，以成一字曰苦，知终身无安逸之时。
现代文：心统治着人的五官及全身，可以说是身体的主宰，所以一定要时刻保持着清醒的心思才能不出错。人的脸是合眉、眼、鼻、口而成形，将两眉当作是部首的草头，把两眼看成一横，鼻子为一竖，下面承接着口，恰巧是一个 苦 字。便可知道人的一生都没有安闲逸乐的时候。
English: The mind governs the five senses and the whole body. It can be said to be the master of the body. Therefore, it is necessary to keep a clear mind at all times in order not to make mistakes. The human face is formed by the eyebrows, eyes, nose and mouth. Consider the two eyebrows as the tip of the head, the two eyes as one horizontal, the nose as one vertical, and the mouth below, which happens to be a bitter character. You can know that there is no time for leisure and pleasure in a person's life.
