古文：不忮不求，可想见光明境界；勿忘勿助，是形容涵养功夫。
现代文：一个人内心坦荡，不嫉恨不贪求，由此可知他的心境是多么光明。在涵养的工夫上，既不要忘记聚集道义以培养浩然正气，也不要因为正气不充足，就想要尽办法帮助它生长。
English: A person's heart is open, not jealous or greedy, which shows how bright his state of mind is. In nurturing, do not forget to gather morality to cultivate vast righteousness, and do not try to help it grow as much as possible because righteousness is not enough.
