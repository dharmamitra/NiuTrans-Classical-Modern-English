古文：义之中有利，而尚义之君子，初非计及于利也；利之中有害，而趋利之小人，并不顾其为害也。
现代文：在义行之中也会得到利益，这个利益是重视义理的君子始料所不及的。在谋利中也会有不好的事情发生，这是一心求利的小人不愿意得到却最终得到的结果。
English: In the course of doing good deeds, one will also receive benefits, which is unexpected by a gentleman who values the principle of righteousness. In the course of making profits, bad things will also happen, which is a result that the villain who seeks profit does not want to get, but eventually gets.
