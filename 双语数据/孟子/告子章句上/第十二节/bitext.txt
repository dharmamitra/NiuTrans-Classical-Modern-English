古文：孟子曰： 今有无名之指，屈而不信，非疾痛害事也，如有能信之者，则不远秦楚之路，为指之不若人也。
现代文：孟子说： 有一个人的无名指弯曲不能伸直，但并不疼痛而且不妨碍做事，如果有人能替他伸直，哪怕是到秦国、楚国去治疗，他也不会觉得路途遥远，这是因为他的手指比不上别人。
English: Mencius said: There is a person whose ring finger is bent and cannot be straightened, but it is not painful and does not interfere with work. If someone can straighten it for him, even if he goes to Qin and Chu for treatment, he will not feel that the journey is far away, because his fingers are not as good as others.

古文：指不若人，则知恶之；心不若人，则不知恶，此之谓不知类也。 
现代文：指头比不上别人，就知道厌恶；良心比不上别人，却不知道厌恶，这就是所谓的认识不到事不同而理同。
English: Fingers are not as good as others, they know disgust; conscience is not as good as others, but they do not know disgust. This is the so-called understanding that things are not different, but the same.
