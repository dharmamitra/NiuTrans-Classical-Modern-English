古文：孟子曰： 拱把之桐梓，人苟欲生之，皆知所以养之者。
现代文：孟子说： 一只手就能握住的小桐树、梓树苗，人们如果想要它生长，都知道应该怎么培养它。
English: Mencius said, "If people want to grow a small paulownia or a young azusa tree, which can be held in one hand, they all know how to cultivate it.

古文：至于身，而不知所以养之者，岂爱身不若桐梓哉？
现代文：而对于自身却不知道怎样去修养。难道爱自身还比不上爱护桐树梓、树苗吗？
English: But they don't know how to cultivate themselves. Isn't loving yourself more important than caring for a tree or a tree seedling?

古文：弗思甚也。 
现代文：真是一点也不往这方面去想。 
English: I really don't think about it at all.
