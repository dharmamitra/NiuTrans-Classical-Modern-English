古文：孟子曰： 舜之饭糗茹草也，若将终身焉；及其为天子也，被袗衣，鼓琴，二女果，若固有之。 
现代文：孟子说： 舜啃干粮吃野草的时候，好像要这样过一辈子；等到他成为天子，穿华贵的衣服，弹着琴，有尧的两个女儿如对贵宾一样侍候他，又好像是本就拥有的。 
English: Mencius said, "When he eats dried grain and wild grass, it seems that he will live like this for the rest of his life. When he becomes the son of heaven, he will wear luxurious clothes, play the piano, and his two daughters with beards will serve him as if they were honored guests, and they seem to be his own.
