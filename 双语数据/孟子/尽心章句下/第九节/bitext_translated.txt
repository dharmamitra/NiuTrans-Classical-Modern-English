古文：孟子曰： 身不行道，不行于妻子；使人不以道，不能行于妻子。 
现代文：孟子说： 自身行事不依正道，那对妻室、子女也推行不了；不按正道使唤别人，那连妻室、子女也使唤不动。 
English: Mencius said, "If you do not act according to the right way, you will not be able to help your wife and children; if you do not help others according to the right way, even your wife and children will not be able to help you.
