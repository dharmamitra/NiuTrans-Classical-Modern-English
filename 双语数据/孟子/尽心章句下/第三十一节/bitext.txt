古文：孟子曰： 人皆有所不忍，达之于其所忍，仁也；人皆有所不为，达之于其所为，义也。
现代文：孟子说： 人都有所不忍心做的事，如果能达到能忍住的程度，就是仁爱了。人都有所不愿意做的事，如果能达到不去做的程度，那就是最佳行为方式了。
English: Mencius said: People all have things they cannot bear to do. If they can reach the level of being able to tolerate them, that is benevolence. People all have things they do not want to do. If they can reach the level of not doing them, that is the best way to behave.

古文：人能充无欲害人之心，而仁不可胜用也；人能充无穿逾之心，而义不可胜用也。
现代文：人们心里如果能充满不想害人的念头，仁爱之心就用之不尽了。人们心里如果能充满不穿墙打洞偷盗的念头，那最佳行为方式就用之不尽了。
English: If people's hearts can be filled with the thought of not wanting to harm others, the heart of benevolence will be inexhaustible. If people's hearts can be filled with the thought of stealing without breaking through the wall, the best way of behavior will be inexhaustible.

古文：人能充无受尔汝之实，无所往而不为义也。
现代文：人们心里如果能充满不接受卑贱的称呼的念头，无论去到哪里都不会不行为于最佳行为方式的。
English: People will not go anywhere without behaving in the best manner if they are imbued with the idea of not accepting lowly names.

古文：士未可以言而言，是以言餂之也；可以言而不言，是以不言餂之也，是皆穿逾之类也。 
现代文：读书人不可以和他言谈而又言谈的，是以言谈诱取他；可以言谈而不言谈的，是以不言谈来诱取他，这些都属于挖洞跳墙一类的行为。 
English: A reader may not talk to him, but if he does talk, he is enticing him with words; if he can talk but does not talk, he is enticing him without words. These are all behaviors like digging a hole and jumping over a wall.
