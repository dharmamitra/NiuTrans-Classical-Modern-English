古文：孟子曰： 好名之人，能让千乘之国；苟非其人，箪食豆羹见于色。 
现代文：孟子说： 喜好名声的人，能把有兵车千辆的国家让给人。如果不是这样的人，即便是叫他让出一碗饭、一碗汤，他不高兴的神情也会表露在脸上。 
English: Mencius said, "A man fond of fame can give away a country with a thousand chariots. If it were not for such a man, even if he were asked to give up a bowl of rice or a bowl of soup, his displeasure would show on his face.
