古文：孟子曰： 居下位而不获于上，民不可得而治也。
现代文：孟子说： 职位低下，又得不到上级的信任，百姓是不可能治理好的。
English: Mencius said, "It is impossible to govern the common people well when one's position is low and one does not have the trust of superiors."

古文：获于上有道；不信于友，弗获于上矣；信于友有道：事亲弗悦，弗信于友矣；悦亲有道：反身不诚，不悦于亲矣；诚身有道：不明乎善，不诚其身矣。是故诚者，天之道也；思诚者，人之道也。
现代文：要得到上级的信任，是有方法的：得不到朋友的信任，也就不能让上级信任了。要使朋友信任，也是有方法的：侍奉父母不能让他们高兴，也就不能让朋友信任了。让父母高兴，也是有方法的：若自我反省孝心不诚，也就不能让父母高兴了。要让孝心出之于诚，也是有方法的：不明白什么是善，也就不能让孝心出之于诚了。所以 诚 是天定的道理，追求 诚 是做人的道理。
English: There is a way to gain the trust of superiors: if you can't get the trust of friends, you can't get the trust of superiors. There is also a way to make friends trust: if you can't make your parents happy by serving them, you can't make your friends trust you. There is also a way to make your parents happy: if you are not honest in your filial piety, you can't make your parents happy. There is also a way to make your filial piety come from sincerity: if you don't understand what is good, you can't make your filial piety come from sincerity. Therefore, sincerity is a principle

古文：至诚而不动者，未之有也；不诚，未有能动者也。 
现代文：出于至诚而不能打动人心，是从来没有过的事；而不诚心，是不能打动人心的。 
English: It has never happened before that a man could not move people's hearts with sincerity, but he could not move people's hearts without sincerity.
