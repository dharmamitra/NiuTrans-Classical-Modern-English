古文：孟子曰： 有事君人者，事是君则为容悦者也。有安社稷臣者，以安社稷为悦者也。有天民者，达可行于天下而后行之者也。有大人者，正己而物正者也。 
现代文：孟子说： 有侍奉君主的一种人，他们侍奉君主就是讨君主欢心；有安邦定国的一种人，他们是以安定国家为乐事；有本性纯真的一种人，他们的发达可通行于天下而后才有天下的通行；有一种人称为大人，他们是端正自己外物便随之端正。 
English: Mencius said: There is a kind of person who serves the monarch, and their service to the monarch is to please the monarch; there is a kind of person who ensures the stability of the country, and they take pleasure in a stable country; there is a kind of person with a pure nature, and their development can pass through the world, and only then can they pass through the world; there is a kind of person called an adult, who straightens themselves and straightens their external things.
