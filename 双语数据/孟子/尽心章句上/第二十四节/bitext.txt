古文：孟子曰： 孔子登东山而小鲁，登泰山而小天下。故观于海者难为水，游于圣人之门者难为言。
现代文：孟子说： 孔子登上东山就觉得鲁国小了，登上泰山就觉得天下小了，所以观看过大海的人就难以注意一般的水流了，在圣人门下学过的人难以注意一般的言论了。
English: Mencius said: When Confucius climbed Dongshan Mountain, he felt that Lu Province was small, and when he climbed Mount Tai, he felt that the world was small. Therefore, people who have seen the sea find it difficult to pay attention to the general flow of water, and people who have studied under the sage find it difficult to pay attention to the general speech.

古文：观水有术，必观其澜。
现代文：观看水有方法，一定要看它壮阔的波澜。
English: There is a way to see water, and you must see its magnificent waves.

古文：日月有明，容光必照焉。
现代文：日月有无比的光辉，再小的间隙也能照射进去。
English: The sun and the moon have incomparable brilliance, and even the smallest gap can be illuminated.

古文：流水之为物也，不盈科不行；君子之志于道也，不成章不达。 
现代文：流水的本性，不充满水坑就不会流走。君子有志追求道，不获得成就，也就不算通达。 
English: The nature of running water is that it will not flow away unless it fills a puddle. If a gentleman has the ambition to pursue a path, he will not be able to achieve it unless he achieves it.
