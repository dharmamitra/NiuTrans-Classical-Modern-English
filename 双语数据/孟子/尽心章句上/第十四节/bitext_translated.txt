现代文：孟子说： 仁德的言辞不如仁德的声望深入人心，良善的政措不如良善的教育更能赢得民众。
English: Mencius said: The words of benevolence are not as popular as the reputation of benevolence, and good policies are not as good as good education to win the people.

古文：善政民畏之，善教民爱之；善政得民财，善教得民心。 
现代文：良善的政措让百姓畏惧，良善的教育让百姓喜爱。良好的政措能让百姓富足，良好的教育能实现民心的拥护。
