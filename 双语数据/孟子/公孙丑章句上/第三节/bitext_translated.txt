古文：孟子曰： 以力假仁者霸，霸必有大国，以德行仁者王，王不待大。
现代文：孟子说： 凭着自己的实力，假借仁义之名者，可以称霸于诸侯，称霸一定要凭借国家实力的雄厚强大。
English: Mencius said: Those who, by virtue of their own strength and under the guise of benevolence and righteousness, can gain supremacy over the princes, must do so by virtue of the strength of the country.

古文：汤以七十里，文王以百里。以力服人者，非心服也，力不赡也；以德服人者，中心悦而诚服也，如七十子之服孔子也。
现代文：依靠道德的力量，推行仁政者，可以称王天下，称王天下不一定要求国家强大；商汤凭借七十里国土，周文王凭借百里国土就使人心归服。用暴力压服别人，人家不是真心信服，而是力量不足以对抗。以德服人的，人家从内心欢愉而真心实意地信服，就像七十多个弟子诚心诚意归服孔子那样。
English: Those who rely on the power of morality and promote benevolent politics can be called the king of the world, and the king of the world does not necessarily require the country to be strong; Shang Tang with seventy miles of land, King Zhou Wen with one hundred miles of land to make people submit. Conquer others with violence, people are not truly convinced, but the strength is not enough to fight. Conquer people with virtue, people are convinced from the heart of joy and sincerely, just as more than seventy disciples sincerely submitted to Confucius.

古文：诗云： 自西自东，自南自北，无思不服。 
现代文：《诗经·大雅·文王有声》上说： 从西到东，从南到北，没有不心悦诚服。 
English: "Poetic Classics, Great Elegance, King Wen's Voice" said: From west to east, from south to north, there is no unsatisfactory sincerity.

古文：此之谓也。 
现代文：说的就是这个道理。 
English: This is exactly what is happening.
