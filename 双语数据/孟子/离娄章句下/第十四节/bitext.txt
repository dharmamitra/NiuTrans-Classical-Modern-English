古文：孟子曰： 君子深造之以道，欲其自得之也。自得之，则居之安；居之安，则资之深；资之深，则取之左右逢其原，故君子欲其自得之也。 
现代文：孟子说： 君子想求很深的造诣是有一定的道路的，但要靠自己的努力才能得到；自己得到了，才能在辨别事物时处之安然；在辨别事物时处之安然，才能给与得深；给与得深，才能在处世中左右探寻到事物的本原；所以君子想要自己得到。 
English: Mencius said: There is a certain way for a gentleman to seek deep accomplishment, but he must rely on his own efforts to obtain it; if he obtains it himself, he can be at ease when distinguishing things; if he is at ease when distinguishing things, he can give depth; if he gives depth, he can explore the origin of things in his life; so a gentleman wants to get it himself.
