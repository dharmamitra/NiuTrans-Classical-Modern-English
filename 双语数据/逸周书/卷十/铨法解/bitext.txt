古文：有三不远，有三不近，有三不畜。
现代文：有所谓三不远，三不近，三不畜。
English: There are so-called three not far, three not near, three not cattle.

古文：敬谋、祗德、亲同，三不远也。
现代文：尊重有智谋的人，敬慕有道德的人，亲近志同道合的人：这三种人不得疏远。
English: To respect the wise, to revere the virtuous, to be close to the like-minded: these three must not be separated.

古文：听谗自乱、听谀自欺，近憝自恶，三不近也。
现代文：听信谗言迷乱了自己，听从恭维欺骗了自己，接近邪恶使自己变恶：这三种人不得亲近。
English: To listen to flattery is to delude oneself, to listen to compliments is to deceive oneself, to draw near to evil is to become evil: these three are not to be approached.

古文：有如忠言竭，亲以为信；有如同好，以谋易寇；有如同恶，合计掬虑，虑泄事败；是谓好害，三不畜也。
现代文：好像是忠言，败坏亲近者以取信于你；好像是与你同好，耍阴谋他代替了寇仇；好像与你同恶，顺随你的计谋分散你的思想，你的想法泄漏，事情就会失败，这就叫巧妙地害人：这三种人不得蓄养。
English: It is as if they were loyal advisers, corrupting those close to them in order to gain their trust; as if they were on your side, scheming with you, and taking revenge on your behalf; as if they were on your side against you, following your schemes, distracting your thoughts, and leaking your ideas, so that things would fail. This is called cleverly harming others: these three types of people cannot be cultivated.
