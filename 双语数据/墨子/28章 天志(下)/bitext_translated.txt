现代文：所以古代的圣人明白地将此道理告诉人们，说： 天子有善，天能赏他；天子有过，天能罚他。 
English: Therefore, the ancient sages clearly told people this truth, saying: If the Son of Heaven is good, Heaven can reward him; if the Son of Heaven exists, Heaven can punish him.

现代文：若天子赏罚不当，刑罚不公，天就会降下疾病灾祸，霜露失时。这时天子必须要喂养牛羊猪狗，洁净地整备粢盛酒醴，去向上天祭祀，祷告，求福。但我从来就不曾听说过上天向天子祷告和求福的。
English: If the heavenly son rewards and punishes improperly, and the punishment is unfair, the heavens will bring down disease and disaster, and frost and dew will disappear. At this time, the heavenly son must feed cattle, sheep, pigs and dogs, cleanly prepare and store wine, and go to sacrifice to heaven, pray, and seek blessings.

古文：苟兼而食焉，必兼而爱之。
现代文：假如兼而食之，必定会兼而爱之，就好象楚、越的国君一样。

古文：譬之若楚、越之君：今是楚王食于楚之四境之内，故爱楚之人；越王食于越，故爱越之人。
现代文：现在楚王在楚国四境之内享用食物，所以爱楚国的人。越王在越国享用食物，所以爱越国的人。

English: Moreover, it is not only for this reason that Heaven loves and protects the people, but also for its own sake. Nowadays, all the countries in the world, all the people who eat rice, kill innocent people, must get a bad omen. Who is the one who kills the innocent? He replied: It is man. Who is the one who gives him the bad omen? It is Heaven.

古文：且天之爱百姓厚矣，天之爱百姓别矣，既可得而知也。
现代文：假若上天内心确实不爱护这些百姓，那为什么在人杀了无辜之后，天要给他以不祥呢？并且上天爱护百姓是很厚重的，上天爱护百姓是很普遍的，这已经可以知道了。
English: If it is true that the heart of God does not care for these people, then why would God give him a bad omen after someone killed an innocent person? And God's love for the people is very thick, God's love for the people is very common, this can already be known.

古文：何以知天之爱百姓也？

现代文：我从从前三代圣王的事迹知道这个。
English: I know this from the deeds of the holy kings of the past three generations.

古文：故昔也三代之圣王，尧、舜、禹、汤、文、武之兼爱之天下也。从而利之，移其百姓之意焉，率以敬上帝、山川、鬼神。

English: The previous three generations of holy emperors, Shun, Yao, Yu, Tang, Wen Wang and Wu Wang, loved the whole world, thereby benefiting the people, changing the minds of the people, and leading them to worship mountains, rivers and ghosts.

古文：天以为从其所爱而爱之，从其所利而利之，于是加其赏焉，使之处上位，立为天子以法也，名之曰圣人，以此知赏善之证。
现代文：上天因为他们爱自己所爱的人，利自己所利的人，于是加重他们的赏赐，使他们居于上位，立为天子，以为表率，称之为圣人。从这可知赏善的证据。
English: Since the gods love those whom they love and benefit those whom they benefit, they increase their rewards and place them on a higher level, making them sons of heaven, setting them up as models, and calling them saints. This is evidence of the appreciation of goodness.

古文：是故昔也三代之暴王，桀、纣、幽、厉之兼恶天下也，从而贼之，移其百姓之意焉。率以诟侮上帝、山川、鬼神。
现代文：从前三代的暴君，如桀、纣、幽王、厉王等，对天下人全都憎恶，残害他们，改移百姓的心意，率领他们侮慢山川、鬼神，天因为他们不跟从自己的所爱，反而憎恶他们，不跟从自己的所利，反而残害他们，于是对他们加以惩罚，使他们父子离散，国家灭亡，丧失社稷，忧及本身。
English: The tyrants of the previous three generations, such as Qu, Qu, Yu Wang, and Li Wang, all hated the people of the world, destroyed them, changed the minds of the people, led them to despise mountains, rivers, ghosts, and gods, because they did not follow what they loved, but hated them, did not follow their own interests, but destroyed them, and then punished them, separated their father and son, destroyed the country, lost the society, and worried about themselves.

古文：天以为不从其所爱而恶之，不从其所利而贼之，于是加其罚焉，使之父子离散，国家灭亡，抎失社稷，忧以及其身，是以天下之庶民属而毁之，业万世子孙继嗣，毁之贲，不之废也，名之曰失王。以此知其罚暴之证。
现代文：而天下的百姓也都非毁他们，到了子孙万世以后，仍然受人们的唾骂，称他们为暴君，这就是罚暴的明证了。

古文：故凡从事此者，圣知也，仁义也，忠惠也，慈孝也，是故聚敛天下之善名而加之。
现代文：所以凡从事于此的，就是圣智、仁义、忠惠、慈孝，所以聚集天下的好名声加到他身上。

古文：则顺天之意也。曰： 力正者，何若？ 
现代文：就是顺从天意。问道： 力政是什么样呢？ 
English: He asked, "What is power politics?"

古文：曰：大则攻小也，强则侮弱也，众则贼寡也，诈则欺愚也，贵则傲贱也，富则骄贫也，壮则夺老也。是以天下之庶国，方以水火、毒药、兵刃以相贼害也。
现代文：回答说：大的攻打小的强的欺侮弱的，多的残害少的，狡诈的欺骗愚笨的，尊贵的傲视卑贱的，富裕的傲慢贫困的，年壮的掠夺年老的，所以天下众国，一齐拿着水火、毒药、刀兵来相互残害。

古文：若事上不利天，中不利鬼，下不利人，三不利而无所利，是谓之贼。
现代文：这种事上不利于天，中不利于鬼，下不利于人，三者不利就无所得利，所以称之为贼。

古文：故凡从事此者，寇乱也，盗贼也，不仁不义，不忠不惠，不慈不孝，是故聚敛天下之恶名而加之，是其故何也？
现代文：凡从事于这些事的，就是寇乱、盗贼、不仁不义、不忠不惠、不慈不孝，所以聚集天下的恶名加在他们头上。
English: Whosoever doeth any of these things, the same is a robber, and a thief, and an evil-doer, and an unrighteous man, and an unfaithful, and an uncharitable man: therefore is the name of this congregation cursed throughout all the earth.

古文：则反天之意也。
现代文：这是什么缘故呢？就是违反了天意。
English: What is the reason for this? It is a violation of God's will.

古文：故子墨子置立天之以为仪法，若轮人之有规，匠人之有矩也。今轮人以规，匠人以矩，以此知方圜之别矣。
现代文：所以墨子设立天志以为仪法，就象轮匠有圆规，木匠有方尺一样，现在轮人使用圆规，木匠使用方尺，以之知道方与圆的区别。
English: For this reason, Mozi established the Tenji as a ceremonial law. Just as wheelwrights have compasses and carpenters have square measures, wheelwrights now use compasses and carpenters use square measures to know the difference between square and round.

古文：是故子墨子置立天之以为仪法，吾以此知天下之士君子之去义，远也！
现代文：所以墨子设立天志以为仪法，我因此而知道天下的士君子离义还很远。

现代文：现在大国的君主自得地说： 我们处于大国地位而不攻打小国，我怎能成为大国呢？ 
English: Now the sovereign of a great power says with confidence: We are in the position of a great power and do not attack small countries. How can I become a great power?

古文：是以差论爪牙之士，比列其舟车之卒，以攻罚无罪之国，入其沟境，刈其禾稼，斩其树木，残其城郭，以御其沟池，焚烧其祖庙，攘杀其牺牷，民之格者，则刭拔之，不格者，则系操而归，丈夫以为仆圉、胥靡，妇人以为舂酋。
现代文：因此差遣他们的爪牙，排列他们的舟车队伍，用以攻伐无罪的国家。

现代文：人民抵抗的，就杀掉；不抵抗的就捆缚回去，男人用作奴仆，马夫，女从用作舂米、掌酒的家奴。那些喜好攻伐的君主，不知道这是不仁不义，还以此通告四邻的国君说： 我攻下别国，覆灭他们的军队，杀了将领多少人。 
English: If the people resist, they are killed; if they do not resist, they are bound back; the men are used as slaves, grooms, and the women as domestic slaves for glutinous rice and wine. Those monarchs who like to attack, do not know that this is unkind and unjust, and also use this to inform the four neighboring sovereigns: I conquered other countries, destroyed their armies, and killed how many generals.

古文：为人后子者，必且欲顺其先君之行，曰： 何不当发吾府库，视吾先君之法美。 
现代文：他邻国的君主，也不知道这是不仁不义，又准备皮币，拿出仓库的积藏派人去犒劳庆赏。那些喜好攻伐的君主又绝对不知道这是不仁不义，又把它写在简帛上，藏在府库中，作为后世子孙的，必定将要顺从他们先君的志行，说道： 为什么不打开我们的府库，看看我们先君留下的法则呢？ 
English: The monarchs of his neighboring countries do not know that this is unkindness and injustice, and they also prepare pennies, take out the warehouse's accumulation of Tibetans and send people to work to celebrate. Those monarchs who like to attack absolutely do not know that this is unkindness and injustice, and they also write it on the letterhead and hide it in the treasury. As the descendants of future generations, they will surely follow the voluntary actions of their forefathers and say: Why not open our treasury and look at the laws left by our forefathers?

古文：必不曰 文、武之为正者，若此矣 ，曰 吾攻国覆军，杀将若干人矣。 
现代文：必定不会写着 文王、武王的政绩象这样 ，而必定写着 我攻下敌国，覆灭他们的军队，杀了将领若干人 。

现代文：这就是我所说的对于大事全不明白的缘故。所谓小事则知道，又怎么样呢？
English: This is what I mean by not understanding the great things. But what about the small things?

现代文：比如现在这里有一个人，他进入别人的果场菜园偷窃人家的桃子、李子、瓜菜和生姜，上面抓住了将会惩罚他，大众听到了就指责他。这是什么原因呢？
English: For example, there is a person here now who entered someone else's orchard and vegetable garden to steal peaches, plums, melons, and ginger. If he is caught, he will be punished, and the public will hear about it and blame him. What is the reason for this?

古文：曰：不与其劳，获其实，已非其有所取之故，而况有逾于人之墙垣，抯格人之子女者乎！
现代文：是因为他不参与种植之劳，却获得了果实，取到了不属于自己的东西的缘故。何况还有翻越别人的围墙，去抓取别人子女的呢！
English: Because he did not labor in the vineyard, yet he has reaped the fruit of it; for he has taken what does not belong to him; and one climbs over another man's wall to seize his children.

古文：今王公大人之为政也，自杀一不辜人者，逾人之墙垣，抯格人之子女者，与角人之府库，窃人之金玉蚤累者，与逾人之栏牢，窃人之牛马者，与入人之场圃，窃人之桃李瓜姜者，今王公大人之加罚此也；虽古之尧、舜、禹、汤、文、武之为政，亦无以异此矣。
现代文：当今的王公大人执掌政治，对于从杀掉一个无罪的人，翻越人家的围墙抓取别人的子女，与角穿别人的府库而偷取人家的金玉布帛，与翻越别人的牛栏马牢而盗取牛马的，与进入人家的果场菜园而偷取桃李瓜果的，现在的王公大人对这些所判的罪，即使古代的圣王如尧、舜、禹、汤、文王、武王等治政，也不会与此不同。
English: Today's kings and queens are in charge of politics. For the crimes of killing an innocent person, climbing over someone's fence to grab someone else's children, stealing someone else's jade cloth by cutting through someone else's treasury, stealing someone else's cattle and horses by climbing over someone else's cattle fence and horse jail, and stealing peaches, plums, and melons by entering someone's orchard and vegetable garden, the kings and queens of today are sentenced to these crimes, even if the ancient holy kings such as Zou, Zou, Yu, Tang, Wen Wang, and Wu Wang governed the country, it would not be different.
