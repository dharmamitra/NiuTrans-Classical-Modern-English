古文：子墨子言曰： 知者之事，必计国家百姓所以治者而为之，必计国家百姓之所以乱者而辟之。 
现代文：墨子说道： 智者做事，必须考虑国家百姓所以治理的原因而行事，也必须考虑国家百姓所以混乱的根源而事先回避。 
English: Mozi said: When doing things, a wise person must consider the reasons why the people of the country govern and act accordingly, and must also consider the reasons why the people of the country are chaotic and avoid them in advance.

古文：然计国家百姓之所以治者，何也？
现代文：然而考虑国家百姓因之治理的原因是什么呢？
English: But what are the reasons for considering the governance of the country by the people?

古文：上之为政，得下之情则治，不得下之情则乱。
现代文：居上位的人施政，能得到下面的实情则治理，不能得到下面的实情则混乱。
English: Those at the top make policy, those who can get the facts from below govern, and those who can't get the facts from below are confused.

古文：何以知其然也？
现代文：怎么知道是这样呢？
English: How do you know that's the case?

古文：上之为政，得下之情，则是明于民之善非也。
现代文：居上位的施政，得到了下边实情，这就对百姓的善否很清楚。
English: The government at the top has obtained the facts at the bottom, which is very clear to the people.

古文：若苟明于民之善非也，则得善人而赏之，得暴人而罚之也。
现代文：假若清楚百姓的善否，那么得到善人就奖赏他，得到暴人就惩罚他。
English: If it were clear whether the people were good or not, then if a good person was caught, he would be rewarded; if a violent person was caught, he would be punished.

古文：善人赏而暴人罚，则国必治。
现代文：善人受赏而暴人受罚，那么国家就必然治理。
English: If good people are rewarded and violent people are punished, then the state will inevitably govern.

古文：上之为政也，不得下之情，则是不明于民之善非也，若苟不明于民之善非，则是不得善人而赏之，不得暴人而罚之。
现代文：如果居上位的施政，不能得知下面的实情，这就是对百姓的善否不清楚。假若不清楚百姓的善否，这就不能得到善人而赏赐他，不能得到暴人而惩罚他。
English: If the high-ranking politicians do not know the following facts, it means that they do not know whether the people are good or not. If they do not know whether the people are good or not, they will not be able to reward the good people and punish the violent people.

古文：善人不赏而暴人不罚，为政若此，国众必乱。
现代文：善人得不到赏赐而暴人得不到惩罚，象这样施政，国家民众就必定混乱。
English: When good men go unrewarded and evil men go unpunished, a nation is doomed to chaos.

古文：故赏不得下之情，而不可不察者也。
现代文：所以赏若得不到下面的实情，是不可不考察其后果的。
English: Therefore, if we do not appreciate the following facts, we must consider the consequences.

古文：然计得下之情，将奈何可？
现代文：然而考虑应该怎么样才可以获知下情呢？
English: However, what should be considered in order to get to know the situation?

古文：故子墨子曰： 唯能以尚同一义为政，然后可矣！ 
现代文：所以墨子说： 只有能用向上统一意见施政，这以后就可以了。 
English: Therefore, Mozi said: Only if we can use the upward unification of opinions to govern, this will be possible in the future.

古文：何以知尚同一义之可而为政于天下也？
现代文：怎么知道向上统一意见，就可以在天下施政呢？
English: How do you know that if you unify your opinions, you can govern the world?

古文：然胡不审稽古之治为政之说乎？
现代文：这为什么不审察古代施政时的情况呢？
English: Why not examine the situation at the time of ancient governance?

古文：古者天之始生民，未有正长也，百姓为人。
现代文：古代上天开始生育下民，还没有行政长官的时候，百姓人各为主。
English: In ancient times, the heavens began to give birth to commoners. When there was no chief executive, the common people were in charge.

古文：若苟百姓为人，是一人一义，十人十义，百人百义，千人千义。
现代文：如果百姓人各为主，这就一人有一个道理，十人有十个道理，百人有百个道理，千人有千人道理。
English: If each of the people is the master, then one person has one principle, ten people have ten principles, a hundred people have a hundred principles, and a thousand people have a thousand principles.

古文：逮至人之众，不可胜计也；则其所谓义者，亦不可胜计。
现代文：及至人数多得不可胜数，那么他们所谓的道理也就多得不可胜数。
English: And if their number be innumerable, their reasonings also are innumerable.

古文：此皆是其义，而非人之义，是以厚者有斗，而薄者有争。
现代文：这样人都认为自己的道理正确，而认为别人的道理不正确，因此严重的发生斗殴，轻微的发生争吵。
English: Such people all think that their own reason is correct, but think that the reason of others is incorrect, so serious fights and minor quarrels occur.

古文：是故天下之欲同一天下之义也，是故选择贤者，立为天子。
现代文：所以上天希望统一天下的道理，因此就选择贤人立为天子。
English: Therefore, since heaven hopes to unify the world, it chooses a wise man to be the son of heaven.

古文：天子以其知力为未足独治天下，是以选择其次，立为三公。
现代文：天子认为他的智慧能力不足单独治理天下，所以选择次于他的贤人立为三公。
English: The divine son thought that his wisdom and ability were not enough to rule the world alone, so he chose the sages next to him to be the three princes.

古文：三公又以其知力为未足独左右天子也，是以分国建诸侯。诸侯又以其知力为未足独治其四境之内也，是以选择其次，立为卿之宰。卿之宰又以其知力为未足独左右其君也，是以选择其次，立而为乡长家君。
现代文：三公又认为自己的智慧能力不足单独辅佐天子，所以分封建立诸侯；诸侯又认为自己的智慧能力不足单独治理他国家的四境之内，因此又选择次于他的贤人，立为卿与宰；卿、宰又认为自己的智慧能力不足以单独辅佐他的君主，因此选择次于他的贤人，立为乡长、家君。
English: The three dukes also believed that their wisdom and ability were not enough to support the heavenly son alone, so they divided the fiefs and established lords; the lords also believed that their wisdom and ability were not enough to govern the four territories of their country alone, so they chose the wise men who were second to him and set them up as lord and vassal; the lord and vassal also believed that their wisdom and ability were not enough to support their monarch alone, so they chose the wise men who were second to him and set them up as village head and family head.

古文：是故古者天子之立三公、诸侯、卿之宰，乡长、家君，非特富贵游佚而择之也，将使助治乱刑政也。
现代文：所以古时天子设立三公、诸侯、卿、宰、乡长，家君，不只是让他们富贵游乐而选择他们，而是将使他们协助自己治理刑政。
English: That is why, in ancient times, the Son of Heaven established the Three Princes, Princes, Lords, Kings, Heads of Villages, and Heads of Families, not only to make them rich and choose them, but also to make them help him govern the criminal justice system.

古文：故古者建国设都，乃立后王君公，奉以卿士师长，此非欲用说也，唯辩而使助治天明也。
现代文：所以古时建国立都，就设立了帝王君主，又辅佐以卿士师长，这不是想用来取悦自己喜欢的人，只是分授职责，使他们助天明治。
English: Therefore, when the national capital was built in ancient times, the emperor and the monarch were set up, and they were assisted by the lord and chief magistrate. This was not to be used to please the people they liked, but to assign duties so that they would help Tian Meiji.

古文：今此何为人上而不能治其下？为人下而不能事其上？
现代文：现在为什么居人之上的人不能治理他的下属，居人之下的人不能事奉他的上级？
English: Now why is it that the superior man cannot rule his inferiors, and the inferior man cannot serve his superiors?

古文：则是上下相贼也。
现代文：这就是上下相互残害。
English: This is mutual destruction from top to bottom.

古文：何故以然？
现代文：什么原因会这样？
English: What could be the reason for this?

古文：则义不同也。
现代文：就是各人的道理不同。
English: It's just that everyone's reasons are different.

古文：若苟义不同者有党，上以若人为善，将赏之，若人唯使得上之赏而辟百姓之毁；是以为善者必未可使劝，见有赏也。
现代文：假若道理不同的人双方有所偏私，上面认为这人为善，将赏赐他。这人虽然得到了上面的赏赐，却免不了百姓的非议，因此，为善的人未必因此而得到勉励，虽然人们看到有赏赐。
English: If two men who are not of the same opinion are partial to each other, and the superior thinks that the man is good, he will reward him. Although the man has received the reward from above, he cannot escape the criticism of the people. Therefore, the man who is good may not be encouraged by it, although people see the reward.

古文：上以若人为暴，将罚之，若人唯使得上之罚，而怀百姓之誉；是以为暴者必未可使沮，见有罚也。
现代文：上面认为这人行暴，将惩罚他，此人虽得到了上司的惩罚，却怀有百姓的赞誉，因此，行暴的人未必可使停止，虽然人们看到了惩罚。
English: It is said that the man who commits violence will be punished, and although he is punished by his boss, he is praised by the people, so the violent person may not be able to stop, although people see the punishment.

古文：故计上之赏誉，不足以劝善，计其毁罚，不足以沮暴。
现代文：所以计议上面的赏赐赞誉，不足以勉励向善，计议上面的非毁惩罚，不足以阻止暴行。
English: Therefore, the above-mentioned reward and praise are not enough to encourage good, and the above-mentioned non-destructive punishment is not enough to prevent violence.

古文：此何故以然？
现代文：这是什么原故使之如此呢？
English: What is the reason for this?

古文：则义不同也。
现代文：就是各人道理不同。
English: It's just that everyone's reasons are different.

古文：然则欲同一天下之义，将奈何可？
现代文：既然如此，那么想统一天下各人的道理，将怎么办呢？
English: That being the case, what should be done if we want to unify everyone's way of thinking?

古文：故子墨子言曰：然胡不赏使家君，试用家君发宪布令其家，曰： 若见爱利家者，必以告；若见恶贼家者，亦必以告。
现代文：所以墨子说道：为何不试着使家君对他的下属发布政令说： 你们见到爱护和有利于家族的，必须把它报告给我，你们见到憎恨和危害家族的也必须把它报告给我。
English: So Mozi said, "Why don't you try to have the head of the family issue a decree to his subordinates, saying, 'If you see anything that is loving and beneficial to the family, you must report it to me, and if you see anything that is hateful and harmful to the family, you must also report it to me.'

古文：若见爱利家以告，亦犹爱利家者也，上得且赏之，众闻则誉之；若见恶贼家不以告，亦犹恶贼家者也，上得且罚之，众闻则非之。 
现代文：你们见到爱护和有利于家族的报告给我，也和爱护和有利家族一样，上面得知了将赏赐他，大家听到了将赞誉他。你们见到了憎害家族不拿来报告，也和憎害家族的一样，上面得知了将惩罚他，大家听到了将非议他。 
English: You have seen the one who loves and benefits his family report to me, just as the one who loves and benefits his family will be rewarded, and the one who hates his family will be praised, and the one who hates his family will be punished, and the one who hates his family will be criticized.

古文：是以遍若家之人，皆欲得其长上之赏誉，辟其毁罚。
现代文：以此遍告这全家的人。人们都希望得到长上的赏赐赞誉，而避免非议惩罚。
English: It's a message for the whole family: people want to be praised by their elders, not punished.

古文：是以善言之，不善言之；家君得善人而赏之，得暴人而罚之，善人之赏，而暴人之罚，则家必治矣。
现代文：所以，见了好的来报告，见了不好的也来报告。家君得到善人而赏赐他，得到暴人而惩罚他。善人得赏而暴人得罚，那么家族就会治理好。
English: Therefore, if you see something good, report it. If you see something bad, report it. If you see someone good, reward him. If you see someone bad, punish him. If you see someone good, reward him. If you see someone bad, punish him. If you see someone good, reward him. If you see someone bad, punish him.

古文：然计若家之所以治者，何也？
现代文：然而计议这一家治理得好的原因是什么呢？
English: However, what is the reason for the good governance of this company?

古文：唯以尚同一义为政故也。
现代文：只是能以向上统一道理的原则治政之故。
English: It's just because they can govern according to the principle of upward unification.

古文：家既巳治，国之道尽此巳邪？
现代文：家已经治好了，治国的办法全都在此了吗？
English: The family has been healed, and the means of governing the country are all here?

古文：则未也。
现代文：那还没有。
English: That hasn't happened yet.

古文：国之为家数也甚多，此皆是其家，而非人之家，是以厚者有乱，而薄者有争。
现代文：国家之中的家数很多，它们都认为自己的家对而别人的家不对，所以严重的就发生动乱，轻微的就发生争执。
English: There are many families in a country, and they all think that their family is right and other people's family is wrong, so when it is serious, there will be turmoil, and when it is light, there will be disputes.

古文：故又使家君总其家之义，以尚同于国君，国君亦为发宪布令于国之众，曰： 若见爱利国者，必以告；若见恶贼国者，亦必以告。
现代文：所以又使家君总其家族的道理，用以上同于国君。国君也对国中民众发布政令说： 你们看到爱护和有利于国家的必定拿它来报告，你们看到憎恶和残害国家的也必定拿它来报告。
English: The sovereign also issued a decree to the people of the country, saying: If you see love and benefit for the country, you must report it; if you see hatred and destruction of the country, you must also report it.

古文：是以民见善者言之，见不善者言之；国君得善人而赏之，得暴人而罚之。
现代文：你们看到爱护和有利于国家的把它上报了，也和爱护和有利国家的一样。上面得悉了将予以赏赐，大家听到了将予以赞誉。你们看到了憎恶和残害国家的不拿来上报，也和憎恶和残害国家的一样。上面得悉了将予以惩罚，大家听到了将予以非议。 以此遍告这一国的人。人们都希望得到长上的赏赐赞誉，避免他的非议惩罚，所以人民见到好的来报告，见到不好的也来报告。国君得到善人予以赏赐，得到暴人而予以惩罚。
English: You have seen that those who love and benefit the country report it, just as those who love and benefit the country report it; those who hate and harm the country report it, just as those who hate and harm the country report it; those who love and benefit the country report it, just as those who love and harm the country report it; those who hate and harm the country report it, just as those who hate and harm the country report it; those who love and benefit the country report it, just as those who love and harm the country report it; those who hate and harm the country report it; those who hate and harm the country report it; those who love and benefit the country report it, just as those who

古文：善人赏而暴人罚，则国必治矣。
现代文：善人得赏而暴人得罚，那么国家必然治理好。
English: If good people are rewarded and violent people are punished, then the country will inevitably be well governed.

古文：然计若国之所治者，何也？
现代文：然而计议这一国治理好的原因是什么呢？
English: However, what is the reason for this country's good governance?

古文：唯能以尚同一义为政故也。
现代文：只是能以向上统一道理的原则治政之故。
English: It's just because they can govern according to the principle of upward unification.

古文：国既巳治矣，天下之道尽此巳邪？
现代文：国家已经治理了，治理天下的办法尽在这里了吗？
English: The country has already been governed. Is this the only way to govern the world?

古文：则未也。
现代文：那还没有。
English: That hasn't happened yet.

古文：天下之为国数也甚多，此皆是其国，而非人之国，是以厚者有战，而薄者有争。
现代文：天下国家为数很多，这些国家都认为自己的国家对而别人的国家不对，所以严重的就发生动乱，轻微的就发生争执。
English: There are many countries in the world, and these countries all believe that their country is right and others' countries are wrong, so serious unrest occurs, and minor disputes occur.

古文：故又使国君选其国之义，以尚同于天子。
现代文：因此又使国君总同各国的意见，用来上同于天子。
English: For this reason, he made the sovereign lord of the country, together with the opinions of all countries, to be the same as the Son of Heaven.

古文：天子亦为发宪布令于天下之众，曰： 若见爱利天下者，必以告；若见恶贼天下者，亦以告。
现代文：天子也对天下民众发布政令说： 你们看到爱护和有利于天下的必定拿它来报告，你们看到憎恶和残害天下的也必定拿它来报告。
English: The Son of Heaven also issued a decree to the people of the world, saying: You see the love and benefit of the world, you must report it. You see the hatred and destruction of the world, you must also report it.

古文：若见爱利天下以告者，亦犹爱利天下者也，上得则赏之，众闻则誉之；若见恶贼天下不以告者，亦犹恶贼天下者也，上得且罚之，众闻则非之。 
现代文：你们看到爱护和有利于天下而拿来报告的，也和爱护和有利于天下的一样。
English: If you see love and benefit the world and report it, it is the same as love and benefit the world.

古文：是以遍天下之人，皆欲得其长上之赏誉，避其毁罚，是以见善、不善者告之。
现代文：以此遍告天下的人。人们都希望得到长上的赏赐赞誉，避免他的非毁惩罚，所以看到好的来报告，看到不好的也来报告。
English: People want to be praised by their superiors and avoid punishment, so they report when they see something good, and report when they see something bad.

古文：天子得善人而赏之，得暴人而罚之，善人赏而暴人罚，天下必治矣。
现代文：天子得到善人予以赏赐，得到暴人而予以惩罚。天下必定治理了。
English: The Son of Heaven is rewarded by the good, and punished by the violent. The world will surely be governed.

古文：然计天下之所以治者，何也？
现代文：然而计议天下治理好的原因是什么呢？
English: However, what is the reason for the good governance in the world?

古文：唯而以尚同一义为政故也。
现代文：只是能以向上统一道理的原则治政的缘故。
English: It is only because they can govern according to the principle of upward unification.

古文：天下既已治，天子又总天下之义，以尚同于天。
现代文：天下已经治理了，天子又总同天下的道理，用来上同于天。
English: Heaven and earth have been governed, and the Son of Heaven has always been the same as the reason of heaven and earth, which is used to be the same as heaven.

古文：故当尚同之为说也，尚用之天子，可以治天下矣；中用之诸侯，可而治其国矣；小用之家君，可而治其家矣。
现代文：所以尚同作为一种主张，它上而用之于天子，可以用来治理天下；中而用之于诸侯，可以用来治理他的国家；小而用之于家长，可以用来治理他的家族。
English: Therefore, it is still a kind of proposition that if it is used for the heavenly son, it can be used to govern the world; if it is used for the princes, it can be used to govern his country; if it is used for the parents, it can be used to govern his family.

古文：是故大用之治天下不窕，小用之治一国一家而不横者，若道之谓也。
现代文：所以大用之治理天下不会不足，小用之治理一国一家而不会横阻，说的就是这个道理。
English: Therefore, the governance of the world with a large use will not be insufficient, and the governance of a country with a small use will not be hindered. This is the reason.

古文：故曰治天下之国，若治一家，使天下之民，若使一夫。
现代文：所以说：治理天下之国，如治一家，使今天下之民如使一人。
English: Wherefore he saith, To govern the kingdoms of this world is as to govern a man's house, and to make the people of this day as one man.

古文：意独子墨子有此而先王无此，其有邪？
现代文：抑或只有墨子有这个主张，而先王没有这个呢？
English: Or is it only Mozi who holds this view, while the former king did not?

古文：则亦然也。
现代文：则先王也是这样的。
English: It was the same for the previous king.

古文：圣王皆以尚同为政，故天下治。
现代文：圣王都用尚同的原则治政，所以天下治理。
English: All the holy kings used the same principle to govern, so the whole world is governed.

古文：何以知其然也？
现代文：从何知道这样呢？
English: How do you know that's the case?

古文：于先王之书也《大誓》之言然，曰： 小人见奸巧，乃闻不言也，发罪钧。 
现代文：在先王的书《大誓》这样说过： 小人看到奸巧之事，知而不言的，他的罪行与奸巧者均等。 
English: In the book of the former king, "The Great Oath," it was said: "If a villain sees treachery and does not speak out, his crime is equal to that of the treacherous."

古文：此言见淫辟不以告者，其罪亦犹淫辟者也。
现代文：这说的就是看到淫僻之事不拿来报告的，他的罪行也和淫僻者的一样。
English: That is to say, seeing lewdness and not reporting it, he is guilty in the same way as the lewd person.

古文：故古之圣王治天下也，其所差论以自左右羽翼者皆良，外为之人，助之视听者众。
现代文：所以古时的圣王治理天下，他所选择作为自己左右辅佐的人，都是贤良。在外边做事的人，帮助他察看和听闻的人很多。
English: Therefore, the ancient holy king ruled the world, and the people he chose as his right and left assistants were all virtuous. There were many people who worked outside and helped him to see and hear.

古文：故与人谋事，先人得之；与人举事，先人成之；光誉令闻，先人发之。
现代文：所以和大家一起谋划事情，要比别人先考虑周到；和大家一起办事，要比别人先成功，荣誉和美好的名声要比别人先传扬出去。
English: Therefore, planning things together with everyone is more thoughtful than others; doing things together with everyone is more successful than others, and honor and good reputation are spread out before others.

古文：唯信身而从事，故利若此。
现代文：唯其以诚信从事，所以有这样多的利益。
English: However, it has so many benefits because it engages in good faith.

古文：古者有语焉，曰： 一目之视也，不若二目之视也；一耳之听也，不若二耳之听也；一手之操也，不若二手之强也。 
现代文：古时有这样的话，说： 一只眼睛所看到的，不如两只眼睛所看到的；一只耳朵听到的，不如两只耳朵听到的；一只手操拿，不如两只手强。 
English: In ancient times, there was a saying: What is seen with one eye is not as good as what is seen with two eyes; what is heard with one ear is not as good as what is heard with two ears; what is handled with one hand is not as good as what is handled with two hands.

古文：夫唯能信身而从事，故利若此。
现代文：惟其以诚信从事，所以如此有利。
English: But they do it with integrity, which is why they're so good at it.

古文：是故古之圣王之治天下也，千里之外，有贤入焉，其乡里之人皆未之均闻见也，圣王得而赏之。
现代文：所以古代圣王治理天下，千里之外的地方有个贤人，那一乡里的人还未全都听到或见到，圣王已经得悉而予以赏赐了。
English: Therefore, the ancient holy king ruled the world. There was a wise man thousands of miles away. The people in that village had not yet heard or seen everything, but the holy king had already learned about it and rewarded them.

古文：千里之内有暴人焉，其乡里未之均闻见也，圣王得而罚之。
现代文：千里之外的地方有一个暴人，那一乡里的人还未全部听到或见到，圣王已经得悉而予以惩罚了。
English: A thousand miles away there was a violent man, whom all the people of the country had not yet heard or seen, and the saintly king had learned of it and punished him.

古文：故唯毋以圣王为聪耳明目与？
现代文：所以认为圣王是耳聪目明吧？
English: So you think the holy king is all ears and eyes, right?

古文：岂能一视而通见千里之外哉？
现代文：难道张眼一望就到达千里之外吗？
English: Is it possible to travel thousands of miles just by opening your eyes?

古文：一听而通闻千里之外哉？
现代文：倾耳一听就到达千里之外吗？
English: Can you hear a thousand miles away?

古文：圣王不往而视也，不就而听也，然而使天下之为寇乱盗贼者，周流天下无所重足者，何也？
现代文：圣王不会亲自前去看，不会靠近去听。然而使天下从事寇乱盗贼的人走遍天下无处容足的原因，是什么呢？
English: The holy king will not personally go to see, will not come close to listen. However, what is the reason why those who are engaged in banditry and theft all over the world have nowhere to stay?

古文：其以尚同为政善也。
现代文：那是以尚同原则治政的好处。
English: That is the advantage of governing on the principle of sameness.

古文：是故子墨子曰： 凡使民尚同者，爱民不疾，民无可使。
现代文：所以墨子说： 凡是使百姓尚同的，如果爱民不深，百姓就不可使令。
English: Therefore, Mozi said, "Anyone who brings the people together, if he does not love the people deeply, the people should not obey him."

古文：曰：必疾爱而使之，致信而持之，富贵以道其前，明罚以率其后。
现代文：即是说：必须切实爱护他们，以诚信之心拥有他们。用富贵引导于前，用严明的惩罚督率于后。
English: That is to say: we must earnestly love them, possess them with a sincere heart, guide them with wealth and dignity, and supervise them with strict punishment.

古文：为政若此，唯欲毋与我同，将不可得也。 
现代文：象这样施政，即使要想人民不与我一致，也将办不到。 
English: If I try to govern in this way, even if the people do not agree with me, it will not work.

古文：是以子墨子曰： 今天下王公大人士君子，中情将欲为仁义，求为上士，上欲中圣王之道，下欲中国家百姓之利，故当尚同之说而不可不察，尚同为政之本，而治要也。 
现代文：所以墨子说： 现在天下的王公大人、士君子们，如果心中确实将行仁义，追求做上士，上要符合圣王之道，下要符合国家百姓之利，因此对尚同这一主张不可不予以审察。尚同是施政的根本和统治的关键。 
English: Therefore, Mozi said, "Nowadays, princes and courtiers of the world, if you truly want to practice benevolence and righteousness in your hearts and aspire to be a staff sergeant, you must conform to the way of the holy king above and the interests of the people of the country below. Therefore, you must examine this proposition. It is still the foundation of governance and the key to rule.
